        "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, but fall short of the performance of supervised methods in generalizing to downstream tasks with limited data. Prompt learning is emerging as a parameter-efficient method for adapting VLMs, but state-of-the-art approaches require annotated samples. In this paper we propose a novel approach to prompt learning based on unsupervised knowledge distillation from more powerful models. Our approach, which we call Knowledge Distillation Prompt Learning (KDPL), can be integrated into existing prompt learning techniques and eliminates the need for labeled examples during adaptation. Our experiments on more than ten standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that KDPL is very effective at improving generalization of learned prompts for zero-shot domain generalization, zero-shot cross-dataset generalization, and zero-shot base-to-novel class generalization problems. KDPL requires no ground-truth labels for adaptation, and moreover we show that even in the absence of any knowledge of training class names it can be used to effectively transfer knowledge.

Despite these advances, VLGs still struggle to follow user instructions for interleaved text and image generation. To address this issue, we introduce LeafInstruct, the first open-sourced interleaved instruction tuning data with over 30,000 high-quality instances across more than 10 domains. Due to the extensive size of existing VLGs, we opt for parameter-efficient tuning. However, we observe that VLGs tuned with a standard LoRA typically exhibit inferior performance in interleaved text-image generation. We attribute this problem to modality interference and the lack of modality-specialized adaptation design. Hence, we propose Lateralization LoRA, a novel modality-specialized adaptation method inspired by the concept of brain lateralization. Lateralization LoRA employs a hybrid approach, combining the traditional linear LoRA and a Convolutional LoRA for generating text and images, enabling the generation of high-quality text and images by leveraging modality-specific structures and parameter sets. We perform instruction tuning of the VLG (i.e., EMU2) using Lateralization LoRA on the LeafInstruct dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMU2 tuned with Lateralization LoRA achieve state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing baseline models in complex interleaved tasks.",

Current methods, which focus on modifying inputs and monitoring changes in the model's output probability scores, often struggle to comprehensively understand bias from the perspective of model components. We propose a framework that incorporates causal mediation analysis to measure and map the pathways of bias generation and propagation within VLMs. This approach allows us to identify the direct effects of interventions on model bias and the indirect effects of interventions on bias mediated through different model components. Our results show that image features are the primary contributors to bias, with significantly higher impacts than text features, specifically accounting for 32.57% and 12.63% of the bias in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively. Notably, the image encoder's contribution surpasses that of the text encoder and the deep fusion encoder. Further experimentation confirms that contributions from both language and vision modalities are aligned and non-conflicting. Consequently, focusing on blurring gender representations within the image encoder, which contributes most to the model bias, reduces bias efficiently by 22.03% and 9.04% in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively, with minimal performance loss or increased computational demands.",

        "abstract": "Pre-trained models produce strong generic representations that can be adapted via fine-tuning. The learned weight difference relative to the pre-trained model, known as a task vector, characterises the direction and stride of fine-tuning. The significance of task vectors is such that simple arithmetic operations on them can be used to combine diverse representations from different domains. This paper builds on these properties of task vectors and aims to answer (1) whether components of task vectors, particularly parameter blocks, exhibit similar characteristics, and (2) how such blocks can be used to enhance knowledge composition and transfer. To this end, we introduce aTLAS, an algorithm that linearly combines parameter blocks with different learned coefficients, resulting in anisotropic scaling at the task vector level. We show that such linear combinations explicitly exploit the low intrinsic dimensionality of pre-trained models, with only a few coefficients being the learnable parameters. Furthermore, composition of parameter blocks leverages the already learned representations, thereby reducing the dependency on large amounts of data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in task arithmetic, few-shot recognition and test-time adaptation, with supervised or unsupervised objectives. In particular, we show that (1) learned anisotropic scaling allows task vectors to be more disentangled, causing less interference in composition; (2) task vector composition excels with scarce or no labeled data and is less prone to domain shift, thus leading to better generalisability; (3) mixing the most informative parameter blocks across different task vectors prior to training can reduce the memory footprint and improve the flexibility of knowledge transfer. Moreover, we show the potential of aTLAS as a PEFT method, particularly with less data, and demonstrate that its scalibility.",

In this work, we introduce Sparse Adaptation for Fine-Tuning (SAFT), a method that prevents fine-tuning from forgetting the general knowledge in the pre-trained model. SAFT only updates a small subset of important parameters whose gradient magnitude is large, while keeping the other parameters frozen. SAFT is straightforward to implement and conceptually simple. Extensive experiments show that with only 0.1% of the model parameters, SAFT can significantly improve the performance of CLIP. It consistently outperforms baseline methods across several benchmarks. On the few-shot learning benchmark of ImageNet and its variants, SAFT gives a gain of 5.15% on average over the conventional fine-tuning method in OOD settings.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit considerable social biases, and various studies have tried to evaluate and mitigate these biases accurately. Previous studies use downstream tasks as prompts to examine the degree of social biases for evaluation and mitigation. While LLMs' output highly depends on prompts, previous studies evaluating and mitigating bias have often relied on a limited variety of prompts. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs when changing prompt variations (task instruction and prompt, few-shot examples, debias-prompt) by analyzing task performance and social bias of LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompts to the extent that the ranking of LLMs fluctuates when comparing models for task performance and social bias. Additionally, we show that LLMs have tradeoffs between performance and social bias caused by the prompts. Less bias from prompt setting may result in reduced performance. Moreover, the ambiguity of instances is one of the reasons for this sensitivity to prompts in advanced LLMs, leading to various outputs. We recommend using diverse prompts, as in this study, to compare the effects of prompts on social bias in LLMs.",

In this study, we strengthen the video features by learning three temporal dynamics in video data: context order, playback direction, and the speed of video frames. Cross-modal attention modules are introduced to enrich video features with audio information so that speech variability can be taken into account when training on the video temporal dynamics. Based on our approach, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the LRS2 and LRS3 AVSR benchmarks for the noise-dominant settings. Our approach excels in scenarios especially for babble and speech noise, indicating the ability to distinguish the speech signal that should be recognized from lip movements in the video modality.

This enrichment not only improves overall communicative efficacy but also enhances the quality of conversational experiences. However, existing methods for dialogue-to-image retrieval face limitations due to the constraints of pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) in comprehending complex dialogues accurately. To address this, we present a novel approach leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate precise dialogue-associated visual descriptors, facilitating seamless connection with images. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark data validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in deriving concise and accurate visual descriptors, leading to significant enhancements in dialogue-to-image retrieval performance. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the method's generalizability across diverse visual cues, various LLMs, and different datasets, underscoring its practicality and potential impact in real-world applications.",

We synthesize sounds on an acoustic continuum between /l/ and /r/ and embed them in controlled contexts where only /l/, only /r/, or neither occur in English. Like humans, Wav2Vec2 models show a bias towards the phonotactically admissable category in processing such ambiguous sounds. Using simple measures to analyze model internals on the level of individual stimuli, we find that this bias emerges in early layers of the model's Transformer module. This effect is amplified by ASR finetuning but also present in fully self-supervised models.

We reach competitive performance of 0.73 mean correlation for the AAI task and achieve up to approximately 87% frame overlap compared to a state-of-the-art text-dependent phoneme force aligner.",

Inspired by the successes in dynamic neural networks, in this paper, we build a novel dynamic feature aggregation (DFA) module that can simultaneously adapt kernel weights and receptive fields at different timestamps. Based on DFA, the proposed dynamic encoder layer aggregates the temporal features within the action time ranges and guarantees the discriminability of the extracted representations. Moreover, using DFA helps to develop a Dynamic TAD head (DyHead), which adaptively aggregates the multi-scale features with adjusted parameters and learned receptive fields better to detect the action instances with diverse ranges from videos. With the proposed encoder layer and DyHead, a new dynamic TAD model, DyFADet, achieves promising performance on a series of challenging TAD benchmarks, including HACS-Segment, THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, Epic-Kitchen 100, Ego4D-Moment QueriesV1.0, and FineAction.

This one box for each text-image data provides sparse supervision signals. Although previous works achieve impressive results, their passive utilization of annotation, i.e. the sole use of the box annotation as regression ground truth, results in a suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present SegVG, a novel method transfers the box-level annotation as Segmentation signals to provide an additional pixel-level supervision for Visual Grounding. Specifically, we propose the Multi-layer Multi-task Encoder-Decoder as the target grounding stage, where we learn a regression query and multiple segmentation queries to ground the target by regression and segmentation of the box in each decoding layer, respectively. This approach allows us to iteratively exploit the annotation as signals for both box-level regression and pixel-level segmentation. Moreover, as the backbones are typically initialized by pretrained parameters learned from unimodal tasks and the queries for both regression and segmentation are static learnable embeddings, a domain discrepancy remains among these three types of features, which impairs subsequent target grounding. To mitigate this discrepancy, we introduce the Triple Alignment module, where the query, text, and vision tokens are triangularly updated to share the same space by triple attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on five widely used datasets validate our state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.",

However, understanding and mitigating its effects on a more fine-grained level is still lacking, especially for harder tasks such as object detection with both classification and regression objectives. This work defines the performance for a subset of task-critical categories, i.e. the critical-category performance, as a crucial yet largely overlooked fine-grained objective for detection tasks. We analyze the impact of quantization at the category-level granularity, and propose methods to improve performance for the critical categories. Specifically, we find that certain critical categories have a higher sensitivity to quantization, and are prone to overfitting after quantization-aware training (QAT). To explain this, we provide theoretical and empirical links between their performance gaps and the corresponding loss landscapes with the Fisher information framework. Using this evidence, we apply a Fisher-aware mixed-precision quantization scheme, and a Fisher-trace regularization for the QAT on the critical-category loss landscape. The proposed methods improve critical-category metrics of the quantized transformer-based DETR detectors. They are even more significant in case of larger models and higher number of classes where the overfitting becomes more severe. For example, our methods lead to 10.4% and 14.5% mAP gains for, correspondingly, 4-bit DETR-R50 and Deformable DETR on the most impacted critical classes in the COCO Panoptic dataset.",

For many PDEs, the corresponding Green's function exhibits asymptotic smoothness. In this paper, we propose a framework named Green Multigrid networks (GreenMGNet), an operator learning algorithm designed for a class of asymptotically smooth Green's functions. Compared with the pioneering GL, the new framework presents itself with better accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving a significant improvement. GreenMGNet is composed of two technical novelties. First, Green's function is modeled as a piecewise function to take into account its singular behavior in some parts of the hyperplane. Such piecewise function is then approximated by a neural network with augmented output(AugNN) so that it can capture singularity accurately. Second, the asymptotic smoothness property of Green's function is used to leverage the Multi-Level Multi-Integration (MLMI) algorithm for both the training and inference stages. Several test cases of operator learning are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. On average, GreenMGNet achieves $3.8\\%$ to $39.15\\%$ accuracy improvement. To match the accuracy level of GL, GreenMGNet requires only about $10\\%$ of the full grid data, resulting in a $55.9\\%$ and $92.5\\%$ reduction in training time and GPU memory cost for one-dimensional test problems, and a $37.7\\%$ and $62.5\\%$ reduction for two-dimensional test problems.",

Previous studies have proposed corpus-level $n$-gram statistics as a regularizer; however, the construction and querying of such $n$-grams, if done naively, prove to be costly and significantly impede training speed, thereby limiting their application in modern large language model pre-training. We introduce an alternative compact representation of the next token distribution that, in expectation, aligns with the complete $n$-gram distribution while markedly reducing variance across mini-batches compared to the standard next-token loss. Empirically, we demonstrate that both the $n$-gram regularized model and our approximation yield substantial improvements in model quality and convergence rate compared to existing methods.

The sense-aware contextualised word embeddings (SCWEs) such as the ones produced by XL-LEXEME by fine-tuning masked langauge models (MLMs) on Word-in-Context (WiC) data attempt to encode such semantic changes of words within the contextualised word embedding (CWE) spaces. Despite the superior performance of SCWEs in contextual/temporal semantic change detection (SCD) benchmarks, it remains unclear as to how the meaning changes are encoded in the embedding space. To study this, we compare pre-trained CWEs and their fine-tuned versions on contextual and temporal semantic change benchmarks under Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) transformations. Our experimental results reveal several novel insights such as (a) although there exist a smaller number of axes that are responsible for semantic changes of words in the pre-trained CWE space, this information gets distributed across all dimensions when fine-tuned, and (b) in contrast to prior work studying the geometry of CWEs, we find that PCA to better represent semantic changes than ICA.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown their effectiveness in code-related tasks. However, existing LLMs for code focus on general code syntax and semantics rather than the differences between two code versions. Thus, it is an open question how LLMs perform on code-change-related tasks. To answer this question, we conduct an empirical study using \\textgreater 1B parameters LLMs on three code-change-related tasks, i.e., code review generation, commit message generation, and just-in-time comment update, with in-context learning (ICL) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT, including LoRA and prefix-tuning). We observe that the performance of LLMs is poor without examples and generally improves with examples, but more examples do not always lead to better performance. LLMs tuned with LoRA have comparable performance to the state-of-the-art small pre-trained models. Larger models are not always better, but \\textsc{Llama~2} and \\textsc{Code~Llama} families are always the best. The best LLMs outperform small pre-trained models on the code changes that only modify comments and perform comparably on other code changes.

Specifically, SA-WavLM follows an \"extract-merge-predict\" pipeline in which the representations of each speaker in the input mixture are first extracted individually and then merged before the final prediction. In this pipeline, SA-WavLM performs speaker-informed extractions with the consideration of the interactions between different speakers. Furthermore, a speaker shuffling strategy is proposed to enhance the robustness towards the speaker absence. Experiments show that SA-WavLM either matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art pre-trained models.",

Consequently, conducting comparative analyses of such sources has become the de facto modus operandi of any business that wishes to give itself a competitive edge over its peers and improve customer loyalty. Sentiment analysis is one such method instrumental in gauging public interest, exposing market trends, and analysing competitors. While traditional sentiment analysis focuses on overall sentiment, as the needs advance with time, it has become important to explore public opinions and sentiments on various specific subjects, products and services mentioned in the reviews on a finer-granular level. To this end, Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), supported by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques which have contributed to a paradigm shift from simple word-level analysis to tone and context-aware analyses, focuses on identifying specific aspects within the text and determining the sentiment associated with each aspect. In this study, we compare several deep-NN methods for ABSA on two benchmark datasets (Restaurant14 and Laptop-14) and found that FAST LSA obtains the best overall results of 87.6% and 82.6% accuracy but does not pass LSA+DeBERTa which reports 90.33% and 86.21% accuracy respectively.",

Existing unsupervised DAOD methods usually perform feature alignments from the target to the source. Unidirectional domain transfer would omit information about the target samples and result in suboptimal adaptation when there are large domain shifts. Therefore, we propose a pairwise attentive adversarial network with a Domain Mixup (DomMix) module to mitigate the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, a deep-level mixup is employed to construct an intermediate domain that allows features from both domains to share their differences. Then a pairwise attentive adversarial network is applied with attentive encoding on both image-level and instance-level features at different scales and optimizes domain alignment by adversarial learning. This allows the network to focus on regions with disparate contextual information and learn their similarities between different domains. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed method.",

Experimental results demonstrate that DA4LG competitively performs across visual and non-visual language descriptions, independent of the completeness of observation. DA4LG achieves state-of-the-art performance in the single-view setting and multi-view setting with the accuracy of 83.8% and 86.8% respectively in the language grounding benchmark SNARE. The simulation experiments show the well-practical and generalized performance of DA4LG compared to the existing methods. Our project is available at https://sites.google.com/view/da4lg.",

However, temporal relationships, a critical feature for audio content, are currently underrepresented in mainstream models, resulting in an imprecise temporal controllability. Specifically, users cannot accurately control the timestamps of sound events using free-form text. We acknowledge that a significant factor is the absence of high-quality, temporally-aligned audio-text datasets, which are essential for training models with temporal control. The more temporally-aligned the annotations, the better the models can understand the precise relationship between audio outputs and temporal textual prompts. Therefore, we present a strongly aligned audio-text dataset, AudioTime. It provides text annotations rich in temporal information such as timestamps, duration, frequency, and ordering, covering almost all aspects of temporal control. Additionally, we offer a comprehensive test set and evaluation metric to assess the temporal control performance of various models.

This paper introduces a new post-training quantization method, GPTQT, to reduce memory usage and enhance processing speed by expressing the weight of LLM in 3bit/2bit. Practice has shown that minimizing the quantization error of weights is ineffective, leading to overfitting. Therefore, GPTQT employs a progressive two-step approach: initially quantizing weights using Linear quantization to a relatively high bit, followed by converting obtained int weight to lower bit binary coding. A re-explore strategy is proposed to optimize initial scaling factor. During inference, these steps are merged into pure binary coding, enabling efficient computation. Testing across various models and datasets confirms GPTQT's effectiveness. Compared to the strong 3-bit quantization baseline, GPTQT further reduces perplexity by 4.01 on opt-66B and increases speed by 1.24 times on opt-30b. The results on Llama2 show that GPTQT is currently the best binary coding quantization method for such kind of LLMs.",

In this regard, conventional cascaded methods suffer from issues such as error propagation, massive parameters, and difficulties in deployment and retaining visual characteristics of the input image. Thus, constructing end-to-end models has become an option, which, however, faces two main challenges: 1) the huge modeling burden, as it is required to simultaneously learn alignment across languages and preserve the visual characteristics of the input image; 2) the difficulties of directly predicting excessively lengthy pixel sequences. In this paper, we propose \\textit{Translatotron-V(ision)}, an end-to-end IIMT model consisting of four modules. In addition to an image encoder, and an image decoder, our model contains a target text decoder and an image tokenizer. Among them, the target text decoder is used to alleviate the language alignment burden, and the image tokenizer converts long sequences of pixels into shorter sequences of visual tokens, preventing the model from focusing on low-level visual features. Besides, we present a two-stage training framework for our model to assist the model in learning alignment across modalities and languages. Finally, we propose a location-aware evaluation metric called Structure-BLEU to assess the translation quality of the generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance compared to cascaded models with only 70.9\\% of parameters, and significantly outperforms the pixel-level end-to-end IIMT model.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, vision Transformers and MLPs have demonstrated remarkable performance in image understanding tasks. However, their inherently dense computational operators, such as self-attention and token-mixing layers, pose significant challenges when applied to spatio-temporal video data. To address this gap, we propose PosMLP-Video, a lightweight yet powerful MLP-like backbone for video recognition. Instead of dense operators, we use efficient relative positional encoding (RPE) to build pairwise token relations, leveraging small-sized parameterized relative position biases to obtain each relation score. Specifically, to enable spatio-temporal modeling, we extend the image PosMLP's positional gating unit to temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal variants, namely PoTGU, PoSGU, and PoSTGU, respectively. These gating units can be feasibly combined into three types of spatio-temporal factorized positional MLP blocks, which not only decrease model complexity but also maintain good performance. Additionally, we enrich relative positional relationships by using channel grouping. Experimental results on three video-related tasks demonstrate that PosMLP-Video achieves competitive speed-accuracy trade-offs compared to the previous state-of-the-art models. In particular, PosMLP-Video pre-trained on ImageNet1K achieves 59.0%/70.3% top-1 accuracy on Something-Something V1/V2 and 82.1% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 while requiring much fewer parameters and FLOPs than other models.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (COT) prompting have demonstrated impressive abilities on simple nature language inference tasks. However, they tend to perform poorly on Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) tasks due to several challenges, including hallucination, error propagation and limited context length. We propose a prompting method, Finite State Machine (FSM) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM for complex tasks in addition to improved effectiveness and trustworthiness. Different from COT methods, FSM addresses MHQA by iteratively decomposing a question into multi-turn sub-questions, and self-correcting in time, improving the accuracy of answers in each step. Specifically, FSM addresses one sub-question at a time and decides on the next step based on its current result and state, in an automaton-like format. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method. Although our method performs on par with the baseline on relatively simpler datasets, it excels on challenging datasets like Musique. Moreover, this approach mitigates the hallucination phenomenon, wherein the correct final answer can be recovered despite errors in intermediate reasoning. Furthermore, our method improves LLMs' ability to follow specified output format requirements, significantly reducing the difficulty of answer interpretation and the need for reformatting.",

To answer, we first define value consistency as the similarity of answers across (1) paraphrases of one question, (2) related questions under one topic, (3) multiple-choice and open-ended use-cases of one question, and (4) multilingual translations of a question to English, Chinese, German, and Japanese. We apply these measures to a few large ($>=34b$), open LLMs including llama-3, as well as gpt-4o, using eight thousand questions spanning more than 300 topics. Unlike prior work, we find that models are relatively consistent across paraphrases, use-cases, translations, and within a topic. Still, some inconsistencies remain. Models are more consistent on uncontroversial topics (e.g., in the U.S., \"Thanksgiving\") than on controversial ones (\"euthanasia\"). Base models are both more consistent compared to fine-tuned models and are uniform in their consistency across topics, while fine-tuned models are more inconsistent about some topics (\"euthanasia\") than others (\"women's rights\") like our human subjects (n=165).",

Without understanding the impact of these factors, it can lead to inconsistent results, inefficient model deployment, and suboptimal tool utilization, ultimately hindering the practical integration and scalability of LLMs in real-world scenarios.

Consequently, heatmaps have also been leveraged for achieving weakly supervised segmentation with image-level supervision. On the other hand, losses can be imposed on differentiable heatmaps, which has been shown to serve for (1)~improving heatmaps to be more human-interpretable, (2)~regularization of networks towards better generalization, (3)~training diverse ensembles of networks, and (4)~for explicitly ignoring confounding input features. Due to the latter use case, the paradigm of imposing losses on heatmaps is often referred to as \"Right for the right reasons\". We unify these two lines of research by investigating semi-supervised segmentation as a novel use case for the Right for the Right Reasons paradigm. First, we show formal parallels between differentiable heatmap architectures and standard encoder-decoder architectures for image segmentation. Second, we show that such differentiable heatmap architectures yield competitive results when trained with standard segmentation losses. Third, we show that such architectures allow for training with weak supervision in the form of image-level labels and small numbers of pixel-level labels, outperforming comparable encoder-decoder models.

This paper further investigates this observation by explicitly modelling context encoding through multi-task learning (MTL) to make the model sensitive to the choice of context. We conduct experiments on cascade MTL architecture, which consists of one encoder and two decoders. Generation of the source from the context is considered an auxiliary task, and generation of the target from the source is the main task. We experimented with German--English language pairs on News, TED, and Europarl corpora. Evaluation results show that the proposed MTL approach performs better than concatenation-based and multi-encoder DocNMT models in low-resource settings and is sensitive to the choice of context. However, we observe that the MTL models are failing to generate the source from the context. These observations align with the previous studies, and this might suggest that the available document-level parallel corpora are not context-aware, and a robust sentence-level model can outperform the context-aware models.",

Prior literature predominantly focuses on pair-based and proxy-based methods to maximize inter-class discrepancy and minimize intra-class diversity. However, these methods tend to suffer from the collapse of the embedding space due to their over-reliance on label information. This leads to sub-optimal feature representation and inferior model performance. To maintain the structure of embedding space and avoid feature collapse, we propose a novel loss function called Anti-Collapse Loss. Specifically, our proposed loss primarily draws inspiration from the principle of Maximal Coding Rate Reduction. It promotes the sparseness of feature clusters in the embedding space to prevent collapse by maximizing the average coding rate of sample features or class proxies. Moreover, we integrate our proposed loss with pair-based and proxy-based methods, resulting in notable performance improvement. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Extensive ablation studies verify the effectiveness of our method in preventing embedding space collapse and promoting generalization performance.",

However, most network architectures rely on a single deep learning architecture, and hybrid networks combining different architectures have been little studied in ASV tasks. In this paper, we propose the GMM-ResNext model for speaker verification. Conventional GMM does not consider the score distribution of each frame feature over all Gaussian components and ignores the relationship between neighboring speech frames. So, we extract the log Gaussian probability features based on the raw acoustic features and use ResNext-based network as the backbone to extract the speaker embedding. GMM-ResNext combines Generative and Discriminative Models to improve the generalization ability of deep learning models and allows one to more easily specify meaningful priors on model parameters. A two-path GMM-ResNext model based on two gender-related GMMs has also been proposed. The Experimental results show that the proposed GMM-ResNext achieves relative improvements of 48.1\\% and 11.3\\% in EER compared with ResNet34 and ECAPA-TDNN on VoxCeleb1-O test set.",

To investigate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted continual pre-training with a 3.8B-parameter model and parallel data across eight different formats. We evaluate these methods on thirteen test sets for Japanese-to-English and English-to-Japanese translation. The results demonstrate that when utilizing parallel data in continual pre-training, it is essential to alternate between source and target sentences. Additionally, we demonstrated that the translation accuracy improves only for translation directions where the order of source and target sentences aligns between continual pre-training data and inference. In addition, we demonstrate that the LLM-based translation model is more robust in translating spoken language and achieves higher accuracy with less training data compared to supervised encoder-decoder models. We also show that the highest accuracy is achieved when the data for continual pre-training consists of interleaved source and target sentences and when tags are added to the source sentences.",

Naively, the LLM needs to re-encode the entire KV cache to provide an accurate prediction. However, this process is computationally expensive, especially when the sequence length is long. Simply encoding the edited subsequence and integrating it to the original KV cache meets the temporal confusion problem, leading to significantly worse performance. We address this efficiency and accuracy trade-off by introducing \\underline{\\textbf{Positional \\textbf{I}ntegrity \\textbf{E}ncoding} (PIE). Building upon the rotary positional encoding, PIE first removes the rotary matrices in the Key cache that introduce temporal confusion and then reapplies the correct rotary matrices. This process ensures that positional relationships between tokens are correct and requires only a single round of matrix multiplication. We validate the effectiveness of PIE through extensive experiments on the RepoBench-C-8k dataset, utilizing DeepSeek-Coder models with 1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B parameters. Our evaluation includes three real-world coding tasks: code insertion, code deletion, and multi-place code editing.

        "abstract": "Videos contain rich spatio-temporal information. Traditional methods for extracting motion, used in tasks such as action recognition, often rely on visual contents rather than precise motion features. This phenomenon is referred to as 'blind motion extraction' behavior, which proves inefficient in capturing motions of interest due to a lack of motion-guided cues. Recently, attention mechanisms have enhanced many computer vision tasks by effectively highlighting salient visual areas. Inspired by this, we propose using a modified Sigmoid function with learnable slope and shift parameters as an attention mechanism to activate and modulate motion signals derived from frame differencing maps. This approach generates a sequence of attention maps that enhance the processing of motion-related video content. To ensure temporally continuity and smoothness of the attention maps, we apply pair-wise temporal attention variation regularization to remove unwanted motions (e.g., noise) while preserving important ones. We then perform Hadamard product between each pair of attention maps and the original video frames to highlight the evolving motions of interest over time. These highlighted motions, termed video motion prompts, are subsequently used as inputs to the model instead of the original video frames. We formalize this process as a motion prompt layer and incorporate the regularization term into the loss function to learn better motion prompts. This layer serves as an adapter between the model and the video data, bridging the gap between traditional 'blind motion extraction' and the extraction of relevant motions of interest.",

In fact, it has been found that instruction tuning on these intermediary reasoning steps improves model performance. In this work, we present a novel method of further improving performance by requiring models to compare multiple reasoning chains before generating a solution in a single inference step. We call this method Divergent CoT (DCoT). We find that instruction tuning on DCoT datasets boosts the performance of even smaller, and therefore more accessible, LLMs. Through a rigorous set of experiments spanning a wide range of tasks that require various reasoning types, we show that fine-tuning on DCoT consistently improves performance over the CoT baseline across model families and scales (1.3B to 70B). Through a combination of empirical and manual evaluation, we additionally show that these performance gains stem from models generating multiple divergent reasoning chains in a single inference step, indicative of the enabling of self-correction in language models.

In this paper we prove a theorem that shows that any ensemble will exhibit at least one of the following forms of prediction instability. It will either ignore agreement among all underlying models, change its mind when none of the underlying models have done so, or be manipulable through inclusion or exclusion of options it would never actually predict. As a consequence, ensemble aggregation procedures will always need to balance the benefits of information use against the risk of these prediction instabilities. This analysis also sheds light on what specific forms of prediction instability to expect from particular ensemble algorithms; for example popular tree ensembles like random forest, or xgboost will violate basic, intuitive monotonicity and fairness properties.",

When employing oriented bounding boxes (OBB) to represent arbitrary oriented objects, the periodicity of angles could lead to discontinuities in label regression values at the boundaries, inducing abrupt fluctuations in the loss function. To address this problem, an OBB representation based on the complex plane is introduced in the oriented detection framework, and a trigonometric loss function is proposed. Moreover, leveraging prior knowledge of complex background environments and significant differences in large objects in aerial images, a conformer RPN head is constructed to predict angle information. The proposed loss function and conformer RPN head jointly generate high-quality oriented proposals. A category-aware dynamic label assignment based on predicted category feedback is proposed to address the limitations of solely relying on IoU for proposal label assignment. This method makes negative sample selection more representative, ensuring consistency between classification and regression features. Experiments were conducted on four realistic oriented detection datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance in oriented object detection with minimal parameter tuning and time costs. Specifically, mean average precision (mAP) scores of 82.02%, 71.99%, 69.87%, and 98.77% were achieved on the DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5, DIOR-R, and HRSC2016 datasets, respectively.",

The key building block of our architecture is the notion of a {\\em block}, where several blocks together constitute an object. Each block is represented as a linear combination of a given number of learnable concept vectors, which is iteratively refined during the learning process. The blocks in our model are discovered in an unsupervised manner, by attending over object masks, in a style similar to discovery of slots \\citep{slot_attention}, for learning a dense object-centric representation. We employ self-attention via transformers over the discovered blocks to predict the next state resulting in discovery of visual dynamics. We perform a series of experiments on several benchmark 2-D, and 3-D datasets demonstrating that our architecture (1) can discover semantically meaningful blocks (2) help improve accuracy of dynamics prediction compared to SOTA object-centric models (3) perform significantly better in OOD setting where the specific attribute combinations are not seen earlier during training.

However, their loss function, still adopting common Object Detection losses, solely governs the bounding box regression output, failing to fully optimize for the above objectives. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we first analyze the attention mechanisms of transformer-based models.

A previous study, RefTeacher, makes the first attempt to tackle this task by adopting the teacher-student framework to provide pseudo confidence supervision and attention-based supervision. However, this approach is incompatible with current state-of-the-art visual grounding models, which follow the Transformer-based pipeline. These pipelines directly regress results without region proposals or foreground binary classification, rendering them unsuitable for fitting in RefTeacher due to the absence of confidence scores. Furthermore, the geometric difference in teacher and student inputs, stemming from different data augmentations, induces natural misalignment in attention-based constraints. To establish a compatible SSVG framework, our paper proposes the ACTive REtraining approach for Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding, abbreviated as ACTRESS. Initially, the model is enhanced by incorporating an additional quantized detection head to expose its detection confidence. Building upon this, ACTRESS consists of an active sampling strategy and a selective retraining strategy. The active sampling strategy iteratively selects high-quality pseudo labels by evaluating three crucial aspects: Faithfulness, Robustness, and Confidence, optimizing the utilization of unlabeled data. The selective retraining strategy retrains the model with periodic re-initialization of specific parameters, facilitating the model's escape from local minima.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, topic classification from tweets attracts considerable research attention. Different classification systems have been suggested thanks to these research efforts. Nevertheless, they face major challenges owing to low performance metrics due to the limited amount of labeled data. We propose Sentence Transformers Fine-tuning (STF), a topic detection system that leverages pretrained Sentence Transformers models and fine-tuning to classify topics from tweets accurately. Moreover, extensive parameter sensitivity analyses were conducted to finetune STF parameters for our topic classification task to achieve the best performance results. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrated that (1) the proposed STF can be effectively used for classifying tweet topics and outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approaches, and (2) the proposed STF does not require a huge amount of labeled tweets to achieve good accuracy, which is a limitation of many state-of-the-art approaches. Our main contribution is the achievement of promising results in tweet topic classification by applying pretrained sentence transformers language models.",

Humans have a self-awareness process that allows us to recognize what we don't know when faced with queries. Inspired by this, our paper investigates whether LLMs can estimate their own hallucination risk before response generation. We analyze the internal mechanisms of LLMs broadly both in terms of training data sources and across 15 diverse Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, spanning over 700 datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals two key insights: (1) LLM internal states indicate whether they have seen the query in training data or not; and (2) LLM internal states show they are likely to hallucinate or not regarding the query. Our study explores particular neurons, activation layers, and tokens that play a crucial role in the LLM perception of uncertainty and hallucination risk. By a probing estimator, we leverage LLM self-assessment, achieving an average hallucination estimation accuracy of 84.32\\% at run time.",

Existing studies typically require meticulous labeling of both atomic and complex activities, a task that is labor-intensive and prone to errors due to the scarcity and inaccuracies of available datasets. Most prior research has focused on datasets that either precisely label atomic activities or, at minimum, their sequence approaches that are often impractical in real world settings.In response, we introduce VCHAR (Variance-Driven Complex Human Activity Recognition), a novel framework that treats the outputs of atomic activities as a distribution over specified intervals. Leveraging generative methodologies, VCHAR elucidates the reasoning behind complex activity classifications through video-based explanations, accessible to users without prior machine learning expertise. Our evaluation across three publicly available datasets demonstrates that VCHAR enhances the accuracy of complex activity recognition without necessitating precise temporal or sequential labeling of atomic activities. Furthermore, user studies confirm that VCHAR's explanations are more intelligible compared to existing methods, facilitating a broader understanding of complex activity recognition among non-experts.",

Various approaches, such as loss weighting strategy design and architectural refinements, have been introduced to expedite convergence. In this study, we propose a novel approach to design the noise schedule for enhancing the training of diffusion models. Our key insight is that the importance sampling of the logarithm of the Signal-to-Noise ratio (logSNR), theoretically equivalent to a modified noise schedule, is particularly beneficial for training efficiency when increasing the sample frequency around $\\log \\text{SNR}=0$. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our noise schedule over the standard cosine schedule. Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of our noise schedule design on the ImageNet benchmark, showing that the designed schedule consistently benefits different prediction targets.",

Careful prompt design births the BACON captions with the help of public-available VLMs and segmentation methods. In this way, we gather a dataset with 100K annotated images, which endow VLMs with remarkable capabilities, such as accurately generating BACON, transforming prompts into BACON format, envisioning scenarios in the style of BACONr, and dynamically modifying elements within BACON through interactive dialogue and more.

        "abstract": "Many recent works have explored using language models for planning problems. One line of research focuses on translating natural language descriptions of planning tasks into structured planning languages, such as the planning domain definition language (PDDL). While this approach is promising, accurately measuring the quality of generated PDDL code continues to pose significant challenges. First, generated PDDL code is typically evaluated using planning validators that check whether the problem can be solved with a planner. This method is insufficient because a language model might generate valid PDDL code that does not align with the natural language description of the task. Second, existing evaluation sets often have natural language descriptions of the planning task that closely resemble the ground truth PDDL, reducing the challenge of the task. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\benchmarkName, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' ability to generate PDDL code from natural language descriptions of planning tasks. We begin by creating a PDDL equivalence algorithm that rigorously evaluates the correctness of PDDL code generated by language models by flexibly comparing it against a ground truth PDDL. Then, we present a dataset of $132,037$ text-to-PDDL pairs across 13 different tasks, with varying levels of difficulty. Finally, we evaluate several API-access and open-weight language models that reveal this task's complexity. For example, $87.6\\%$ of the PDDL problem descriptions generated by GPT-4o are syntactically parseable, $82.2\\%$ are valid, solve-able problems, but only $35.1\\%$ are semantically correct, highlighting the need for a more rigorous benchmark for this problem.",

Our findings suggest that LLMs struggle to comprehend constraints in all representations irrespective of their portions in the pre-training data.

In this paper, we challenge this idea by exploring if it is possible to bridge the scale between general-domain datasets and (traditionally smaller) domain-specific datasets to reduce the current performance gap. More specifically, we propose Precision at Scale (PaS), a novel method for the autonomous creation of domain-specific datasets on-demand. The modularity of the PaS pipeline enables leveraging state-of-the-art foundational and generative models to create a collection of images of any given size belonging to any given domain with minimal human intervention. Extensive analysis in two complex domains, proves the superiority of PaS datasets over existing traditional domain-specific datasets in terms of diversity, scale, and effectiveness in training visual transformers and convolutional neural networks. Most notably, we prove that automatically generated domain-specific datasets lead to better pretraining than large-scale supervised datasets such as ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21k. Concretely, models trained on domain-specific datasets constructed by PaS pipeline, beat ImageNet-1k pretrained backbones by at least 12% in all the considered domains and classification tasks and lead to better food domain performance than supervised ImageNet-21k pretrain while being 12 times smaller.

Empirical evaluation shows the enhanced performance of our method across common vision datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 pretrained on ResNet18 and WideResNet classifiers.

Despite several successful use cases, researchers also raised concerns around model collapse and drawbacks of imitating other models. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that synthetic data varies in quality and diversity. Effective use of synthetic data usually requires significant human effort in curating the data. We focus on using synthetic data for post-training, specifically creating data by powerful models to teach a new skill or behavior to another model, we refer to this setting as Generative Teaching. We introduce AgentInstruct, an extensible agentic framework for automatically creating large amounts of diverse and high-quality synthetic data. AgentInstruct can create both the prompts and responses, using only raw data sources like text documents and code files as seeds. We demonstrate the utility of AgentInstruct by creating a post training dataset of 25M pairs to teach language models different skills, such as text editing, creative writing, tool usage, coding, reading comprehension, etc. The dataset can be used for instruction tuning of any base model. We post-train Mistral-7b with the data. When comparing the resulting model Orca-3 to Mistral-7b-Instruct (which uses the same base model), we observe significant improvements across many benchmarks. For example, 40% improvement on AGIEval, 19% improvement on MMLU, 54% improvement on GSM8K, 38% improvement on BBH and 45% improvement on AlpacaEval. Additionally, it consistently outperforms other models such as LLAMA-8B-instruct and GPT-3.5-turbo.",

        "abstract": "For large language models (LLMs) like NLLB and GPT, translating idioms remains a challenge. Our goal is to enhance translation fidelity by improving LLM processing of idiomatic language while preserving the original linguistic style. This has a significant social impact, as it preserves cultural nuances and ensures translated texts retain their intent and emotional resonance, fostering better cross-cultural communication. Previous work has utilized knowledge bases like IdiomKB by providing the LLM with the meaning of an idiom to use in translation. Although this method yielded better results than a direct translation, it is still limited in its ability to preserve idiomatic writing style across languages. In this research, we expand upon the knowledge base to find corresponding idioms in the target language. Our research performs translations using two methods: The first method employs the SentenceTransformers model to semantically generate cosine similarity scores between the meanings of the original and target language idioms, selecting the best idiom (Cosine Similarity method). The second method uses an LLM to find a corresponding idiom in the target language for use in the translation (LLM-generated idiom method). As a baseline, we performed a direct translation without providing additional information. Human evaluations on the English -> Chinese, and Chinese -> English show the Cosine Similarity Lookup method out-performed others in all GPT4o translations. To further build upon IdiomKB, we developed a low-resource Urdu dataset containing Urdu idioms and their translations. Despite dataset limitations, the Cosine Similarity Lookup method shows promise, potentially overcoming language barriers and enabling the exploration of diverse literary works in Chinese and Urdu.

For the past three decades, computational research on comics has evolved from basic object detection to more sophisticated tasks. However, the field faces persistent challenges such as small datasets, inconsistent annotations, inaccessible model weights, and results that cannot be directly compared due to varying train/test splits and metrics. To address these issues, we aim to standardize annotations across datasets, introduce a variety of comic styles into the datasets, and establish benchmark results with clear, replicable settings. Our proposed Comics Datasets Framework standardizes dataset annotations into a common format and addresses the overrepresentation of manga by introducing Comics100, a curated collection of 100 books from the Digital Comics Museum, annotated for detection in our uniform format. We have benchmarked a variety of detection architectures using the Comics Datasets Framework. All related code, model weights, and detailed evaluation processes are available at https://github.com/emanuelevivoli/cdf, ensuring transparency and facilitating replication. This initiative is a significant advancement towards improving object detection in comics, laying the groundwork for more complex computational tasks dependent on precise object recognition.",

(2) Discarding unlabeled data with confidence below the thresholds results in the loss of discriminating information. To solve these issues, we develop an effective method to make sufficient use of unlabeled data. Specifically, we design a self adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy, which thresholds for each class can be dynamically adjusted to increase the number of reliable samples. Meanwhile, in order to effectively utilise unlabeled data with confidence below the thresholds, we propose an unreliable sample contrastive loss to mine the discriminative information in low-confidence samples by learning the similarities and differences between sample features.

In this paper, we propose a efficient method for transferring a pre-trained single-image super-resolution (SISR) transformer network to the domain of stereo image super-resolution (SteISR) through a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Specifically, we introduce the concept of stereo adapters and spatial adapters which are incorporated into the pre-trained SISR transformer network. Subsequently, the pre-trained SISR model is frozen, enabling us to fine-tune the adapters using stereo datasets along. By adopting this training method, we enhance the ability of the SISR model to accurately infer stereo images by 0.79dB on the Flickr1024 dataset. This method allows us to train only 4.8% of the original model parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance on four commonly used SteISR benchmarks.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have an unrivaled and invaluable ability to \"align\" their output to a diverse range of human preferences, by mirroring them in the text they generate. The internal characteristics of such models, however, remain largely opaque. This work presents the Injectable Realignment Model (IRM) as a novel approach to language model interpretability and explainability. Inspired by earlier work on Neural Programming Interfaces, we construct and train a small network -- the IRM -- to induce emotion-based alignments within a 7B parameter LLM architecture. The IRM outputs are injected via layerwise addition at various points during the LLM's forward pass, thus modulating its behavior without changing the weights of the original model. This isolates the alignment behavior from the complex mechanisms of the transformer model. Analysis of the trained IRM's outputs reveals a curious pattern. Across more than 24 training runs and multiple alignment datasets, patterns of IRM activations align themselves in striations associated with a neuron's index within each transformer layer, rather than being associated with the layers themselves. Further, a single neuron index (1512) is strongly correlated with all tested alignments. This result, although initially counterintuitive, is directly attributable to design choices present within almost all commercially available transformer architectures, and highlights a potential weak point in Meta's pretrained Llama 2 models. It also demonstrates the value of the IRM architecture for language model analysis and interpretability.

QAP is evaluated on GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT 4 Turbo on arithmetic datasets GSM8K, AQuA, and SAT and commonsense dataset StrategyQA. QAP is compared with other state-of-the-art prompts including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Plan and Solve Prompting (PS+) and Take A Deep Breath (TADB). QAP outperforms all state-of-the-art prompts on AQuA and SAT datasets on both GPT3.5 and GPT4. QAP consistently ranks among the top-2 prompts on 75\\% of the tests. A key factor of QAP performance can be attributed to response length, where detailed responses are beneficial when answering harder questions, but can negatively affect easy questions.",

However, LLMs still struggle with generating non-factual responses due to limitations in their parametric memory. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address this issue by incorporating external knowledge with a retrieval module. Despite their successes, however, current RAG systems face challenges with retrieval failures and the limited ability of LLMs to filter out irrelevant information. Therefore, in this work, we propose DSLR (Document Refinement with Sentence-Level Re-ranking and Reconstruction), an unsupervised framework that decomposes retrieved documents into sentences, filters out irrelevant sentences, and reconstructs them again into coherent passages. We experimentally validate DSLR on multiple open-domain QA datasets and the results demonstrate that DSLR significantly enhances the RAG performance over conventional fixed-size passage. Furthermore, our DSLR enhances performance in specific, yet realistic scenarios without the need for additional training, providing an effective and efficient solution for refining retrieved documents in RAG systems.",

Although quality inspection can be made by a human expert while manufacturing, this operation is prone to errors. One possible solution may be using standard machine vision techniques to automatically detect defects on wood surfaces. Due to the random texture on wood surfaces, this solution is also not possible most of the times. Therefore, more advanced and novel machine vision techniques are needed to automatically inspect wood surfaces. In this study, we propose such a solution based on support region extraction from the gradient magnitude and the Laplacian of Gaussian response of the wood surface image. We introduce novel structural and conditional statistical features using these support regions. Then, we classify different defect types on wood surfaces using our novel features. We tested our automated wood surface inspection system on a large data set and obtained very promising results.",

ACKs are characterized by mathematical functions governed by analytic kernel parameters (AKPs) learned in training process. Learnable AKPs permit the adaptive update of incorporated knowledge to align with the features representation of data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the ACLs not only have a remarkable capacity for feature representation with a reduced number of parameters but also attain increased reliability through the analytical formulation of ACKs.

        "abstract": "Certifiable robustness gives the guarantee that small perturbations around an input to a classifier will not change the prediction. There are two approaches to provide certifiable robustness to adversarial examples: a) explicitly training classifiers with small Lipschitz constants, and b) Randomized smoothing, which adds random noise to the input to create a smooth classifier. We propose \\textit{SPLITZ}, a practical and novel approach which leverages the synergistic benefits of both the above ideas into a single framework. Our main idea is to \\textit{split} a classifier into two halves, constrain the Lipschitz constant of the first half, and smooth the second half via randomization. Motivation for \\textit{SPLITZ} comes from the observation that many standard deep networks exhibit heterogeneity in Lipschitz constants across layers. \\textit{SPLITZ} can exploit this heterogeneity while inheriting the scalability of randomized smoothing. We present a principled approach to train \\textit{SPLITZ} and provide theoretical analysis to derive certified robustness guarantees during inference. We present a comprehensive comparison of robustness-accuracy tradeoffs and show that \\textit{SPLITZ} consistently improves upon existing state-of-the-art approaches on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. For instance, with $\\ell_2$ norm perturbation budget of \\textbf{$\u03b5=1$}, \\textit{SPLITZ} achieves $\\textbf{43.2\\%}$ top-1 test accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset compared to state-of-art top-1 test accuracy $\\textbf{39.8\\%}",

Nowadays, an emerging trend in the current video distribution system is to take advantage of DNN's overfitting properties to perform video resolution upscaling. By splitting videos into chunks and applying a super-resolution (SR) model to overfit each chunk, this scheme of SR models plus video chunks is able to replace traditional video transmission to enhance video quality and transmission efficiency. However, many models and chunks are needed to guarantee high performance, which leads to tremendous overhead on model switching and memory footprints at the user end. To resolve such problems, we propose a Dynamic Deep neural network assisted by a Content-Aware data processing pipeline to reduce the model number down to one (Dy-DCA), which helps promote performance while conserving computational resources. Additionally, to achieve real acceleration on the user end, we designed a framework that optimizes dynamic features (e.g., dynamic shapes, sizes, and control flow) in Dy-DCA to enable a series of compilation optimizations, including fused code generation, static execution planning, etc. By employing such techniques, our method achieves better PSNR and real-time performance (33 FPS) on an off-the-shelf mobile phone. Meanwhile, assisted by our compilation optimization, we achieve a 1.7$\\times$ speedup while saving up to 1.61$\\times$ memory consumption.

ShiftAddAug uses costly multiplication to augment efficient but less powerful multiplication-free operators, improving performance without any inference overhead. It puts a ShiftAdd tiny NN into a large multiplicative model and encourages it to be trained as a sub-model to obtain additional supervision. In order to solve the weight discrepancy problem between hybrid operators, a new weight sharing method is proposed. Additionally, a novel two stage neural architecture search is used to obtain better augmentation effects for smaller but stronger multiplication-free tiny neural networks. The superiority of ShiftAddAug is validated through experiments in image classification and semantic segmentation, consistently delivering noteworthy enhancements. Remarkably, it secures up to a 4.95% increase in accuracy on the CIFAR100 compared to its directly trained counterparts, even surpassing the performance of multiplicative NNs.",

While multiple such systems have been described in the literature, they typically suffer from a lack of clear and denotational semantics, a limitation which often leads to confusion with respect to their expressive power. In order to address this issue, our system is based on an automaton model which is a combination of symbolic and register automata. We extend previous work on these types of automata, in order to construct a formalism with clear semantics and a corresponding automaton model whose properties can be formally investigated. We call such automata Symbolic Register Transducers (SRT). We show that SRT are closed under various operators, but are not in general closed under complement and they are not determinizable. However, they are closed under these operations when a window operator, quintessential in Complex Event Recognition, is used. We show how SRT can be used in CER in order to detect patterns upon streams of events, using our framework that provides declarative and compositional semantics, and that allows for a systematic treatment of such automata. For SRT to work in pattern detection, we allow them to mark events from the input stream as belonging to a complex event or not, hence the name \"transducers\". We also present an implementation of SRT which can perform CER. We compare our SRT-based CER engine against other state-of-the-art CER systems and show that it is both more expressive and more efficient.",

In comparison with previous methods that relied on the global semantics of input images, EGIInet efficiently combines the information from two modalities by leveraging the geometric nature of the completion task. Specifically, we propose an explicitly guided information interaction strategy supported by modal alignment for point cloud completion. First, in contrast to previous methods which simply use 2D and 3D backbones to encode features respectively, we unified the encoding process to promote modal alignment. Second, we propose a novel explicitly guided information interaction strategy that could help the network identify critical information within images, thus achieving better guidance for completion.

The ability to predict and understand these behaviors offers opportunities to provide adaptive and personalized assistance, for example helping users with varying sensory abilities navigate complex social scenes and instantiating virtual moderators with natural behaviors. In this work, we predict turn-taking behaviors using features extracted based on social dynamics literature. We discuss results from a large-scale VR classroom dataset consisting of 77 sessions and 1660 minutes of small-group social interactions collected over four weeks. In our evaluation, gradient boosting classifiers achieved the best performance, with accuracies of 0.71--0.78 AUC (area under the ROC curve) across three tasks concerning the \"what\", \"who\", and \"when\" of turn-taking behaviors. In interpreting these models, we found that group size, listener personality, speech-related behavior (e.g., time elapsed since the listener's last speech event), group gaze (e.g., how much the group looks at the speaker), as well as the listener's and previous speaker's head pitch, head y-axis position, and left hand y-axis position more saliently influenced predictions. Results suggested that these features remain reliable indicators in novel social VR settings, as prediction performance is robust over time and with groups and activities not used in the training dataset.

        "abstract": "Background: Machine learning (ML) model composition is a popular technique to mitigate shortcomings of a single ML model and to design more effective ML-enabled systems. While ensemble learning, i.e., forwarding the same request to several models and fusing their predictions, has been studied extensively for accuracy, we have insufficient knowledge about how to design energy-efficient ensembles. Objective: We therefore analyzed three types of design decisions for ensemble learning regarding a potential trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption: a) ensemble size, i.e., the number of models in the ensemble, b) fusion methods (majority voting vs. a meta-model), and c) partitioning methods (whole-dataset vs. subset-based training). Methods: By combining four popular ML algorithms for classification in different ensembles, we conducted a full factorial experiment with 11 ensembles x 4 datasets x 2 fusion methods x 2 partitioning methods (176 combinations). For each combination, we measured accuracy (F1-score) and energy consumption in J (for both training and inference). Results: While a larger ensemble size significantly increased energy consumption (size 2 ensembles consumed 37.49% less energy than size 3 ensembles, which in turn consumed 26.96% less energy than the size 4 ensembles), it did not significantly increase accuracy. Furthermore, majority voting outperformed meta-model fusion both in terms of accuracy (Cohen's d of 0.38) and energy consumption (Cohen's d of 0.92). Lastly, subset-based training led to significantly lower energy consumption (Cohen's d of 0.91), while training on the whole dataset did not increase accuracy significantly. Conclusions: From a Green AI perspective, we recommend designing ensembles of small size (2 or maximum 3 models), using subset-based training, majority voting, and energy-efficient ML algorithms like decision trees, Naive Bayes, or KNN.",

This paper proposes frequency-controlled diffusion model (FCDiffusion), an end-to-end diffusion-based framework that contributes a novel solution to text-guided I2I from a frequency-domain perspective. At the heart of our framework is a feature-space frequency-domain filtering module based on Discrete Cosine Transform, which filters the latent features of the source image in the DCT domain, yielding filtered image features bearing different DCT spectral bands as different control signals to the pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model. We reveal that control signals of different DCT spectral bands bridge the source image and the T2I generated image in different correlations (e.g., style, structure, layout, contour, etc.), and thus enable versatile I2I applications emphasizing different I2I correlations, including style-guided content creation, image semantic manipulation, image scene translation, and image style translation. Different from related approaches, FCDiffusion establishes a unified text-guided I2I framework suitable for diverse image translation tasks simply by switching among different frequency control branches at inference time. The effectiveness and superiority of our method for text-guided I2I are demonstrated with extensive experiments both qualitatively and quantitatively.

To address these challenges, we propose a \\textit{model-agnostic} Video Alignment and Answer Aggregation (VA$^{3}$) framework, which is capable of enhancing both compositional consistency and accuracy of existing VidQA methods by integrating video aligner and answer aggregator modules. The video aligner hierarchically selects the relevant video clips based on the question, while the answer aggregator deduces the answer to the question based on its sub-questions, with compositional consistency ensured by the information flow along question decomposition graph and the contrastive learning strategy. We evaluate our framework on three settings of the AGQA-Decomp dataset with three baseline methods, and propose new metrics to measure the compositional consistency of VidQA methods more comprehensively. Moreover, we propose a large language model (LLM) based automatic question decomposition pipeline to apply our framework to any VidQA dataset. We extend MSVD and NExT-QA datasets with it to evaluate our VA$^3$ framework on broader scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our framework improves both compositional consistency and accuracy of existing methods, leading to more interpretable real-world VidQA models.",

This limits the use of domain-specific heuristics. Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a search technique for game playing that does not rely on domain-specific knowledge. This paper discusses eight enhancements for MCTS in GVGP; Progressive History, N-Gram Selection Technique, Tree Reuse, Breadth-First Tree Initialization, Loss Avoidance, Novelty-Based Pruning, Knowledge-Based Evaluations, and Deterministic Game Detection. Some of these are known from existing literature, and are either extended or introduced in the context of GVGP, and some are novel enhancements for MCTS. Most enhancements are shown to provide statistically significant increases in win percentages when applied individually. When combined, they increase the average win percentage over sixty different games from 31.0% to 48.4% in comparison to a vanilla MCTS implementation, approaching a level that is competitive with the best agents of the GVG-AI competition in 2015.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation is vital for understanding the change of treatment effect across individuals or subgroups. Most existing HTE estimation methods focus on addressing selection bias induced by imbalanced distributions of confounders between treated and control units, but ignore distribution shifts across populations. Thereby, their applicability has been limited to the in-distribution (ID) population, which shares a similar distribution with the training dataset. In real-world applications, where population distributions are subject to continuous changes, there is an urgent need for stable HTE estimation across out-of-distribution (OOD) populations, which, however, remains an open problem. As pioneers in resolving this problem, we propose a novel Stable Balanced Representation Learning with Hierarchical-Attention Paradigm (SBRL-HAP) framework, which consists of 1) Balancing Regularizer for eliminating selection bias, 2) Independence Regularizer for addressing the distribution shift issue, 3) Hierarchical-Attention Paradigm for coordination between balance and independence. In this way, SBRL-HAP regresses counterfactual outcomes using ID data, while ensuring the resulting HTE estimation can be successfully generalized to out-of-distribution scenarios, thereby enhancing the model's applicability in real-world settings. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our SBRL-HAP in achieving stable HTE estimation across OOD populations, with an average 10% reduction in the error metric PEHE and 11% decrease in the ATE bias, compared to the SOTA methods.",

Despite deep learning models being proposed for vulnerability detection, their reliability is questionable. Prior evaluations show high recall/F1 scores of up to 99%, but these models underperform in practical scenarios, particularly when assessed on entire codebases rather than just the fixing commit. This paper introduces Real-Vul, a comprehensive dataset representing real-world scenarios for evaluating vulnerability detection models. Evaluating DeepWukong, LineVul, ReVeal, and IVDetect shows a significant drop in performance, with precision decreasing by up to 95 percentage points and F1 scores by up to 91 points. Furthermore, Model performance fluctuates based on vulnerability characteristics, with better F1 scores for information leaks or code injection than for path resolution or predictable return values. The results highlight a significant performance gap that needs addressing before deploying deep learning-based vulnerability detection in practical settings. Overfitting is identified as a key issue, and an augmentation technique is proposed, potentially improving performance by up to 30%. Contributions include a dataset creation approach for better model evaluation, Real-Vul dataset, and empirical evidence of deep learning models struggling in real-world settings.",

In this work, we provide a novel conformal prediction method for potential outcomes of continuous treatments. We account for the additional uncertainty introduced through propensity estimation so that our conformal prediction intervals are valid even if the propensity score is unknown. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We derive finite-sample prediction intervals for potential outcomes of continuous treatments. (2) We provide an algorithm for calculating the derived intervals. (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of the conformal prediction intervals in experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose conformal prediction for continuous treatments when the propensity score is unknown and must be estimated from data.",

Along with the emergence of these methods, questions arise such as \"How Reliable and Stable are XAI Methods?\". With the aim of shedding light on this main question, this research creates a pipeline that performs experiments using the diabetes dataset and four different machine learning models (LGBM, MLP, DT and KNN), creating different levels of perturbations of the test data and finally generates explanations from the eXirt method regarding the confidence of the models and also feature relevances ranks from all XAI methods mentioned, in order to measure their stability in the face of perturbations. As a result, it was found that eXirt was able to identify the most reliable models among all those used. It was also found that current XAI methods are sensitive to perturbations, with the exception of one specific method.",

Previous work has investigated the nexus between climate change, conflict, migration and food security at the household level, however these relations are still largely unexplored at national scales. In this context, during the Complexity72h workshop, held at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in June 2024, we explored the co-evolution of international migration flows and food insecurity at the national scale, accounting for remittances, as well as for changes in the economic, conflict, and climate situation. To this aim, we gathered data from several publicly available sources (Food and Agriculture Organization, World Bank, and UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) and analyzed the association between food insecurity and migration, migration and remittances, and remittances and food insecurity. We then propose a framework linking together these associations to model the co-evolution of food insecurity and international migrations.",

As it is well-known that stereo matching boils down to a per-pixel disparity estimation problem, the popular state-of-the-art stereo-matching approaches widely rely on regressing the scene disparity values, yet via discretization of scene disparity values. Such discretization often fails to capture the nuanced, continuous nature of scene depth. Stereo Risk departs from the conventional discretization approach by formulating the scene disparity as an optimal solution to a continuous risk minimization problem, hence the name \"stereo risk\". We demonstrate that $L^1$ minimization of the proposed continuous risk function enhances stereo-matching performance for deep networks, particularly for disparities with multi-modal probability distributions. Furthermore, to enable the end-to-end network training of the non-differentiable $L^1$ risk optimization, we exploited the implicit function theorem, ensuring a fully differentiable network. A comprehensive analysis demonstrates our method's theoretical soundness and superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various benchmark datasets, including KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, SceneFlow, and Middlebury 2014.",

In the first individual model, we introduce the individual protection degree that effectively suppresses the epidemic level as a stochastic variable to the SIRS model. In the alternative population model, an open Markov queueing network is constructed to investigate the individual number of each epidemic state, and we present an evolving population network via the migration of people. Besides, stochastic methods are applied to analyze both models. In various simulations, the infected probability, the number of individuals in each state and its limited distribution are demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "Proving mathematical theorems using computer-verifiable formal languages like Lean significantly impacts mathematical reasoning. One approach to formal theorem proving involves generating complete proofs using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Natural Language (NL) proofs. Similar methods have shown promising results in code generation. However, most modern LLMs exhibit suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of aligned NL and Formal Language (FL) theorem-proving data. This scarcity results in a paucity of methodologies for training LLMs and techniques to fully utilize their capabilities in composing formal proofs. To address the challenges, this paper proposes **TheoremLlama**, an end-to-end framework to train a general-purpose LLM to become a Lean4 expert. This framework encompasses NL-FL aligned dataset generation methods, training approaches for the LLM formal theorem prover, and techniques for LLM Lean4 proof writing. Using the dataset generation method, we provide *Open Bootstrapped Theorems* (OBT), an NL-FL aligned and bootstrapped dataset. A key innovation in this framework is the NL-FL bootstrapping method, where NL proofs are integrated into Lean4 code for training datasets, leveraging the NL reasoning ability of LLMs for formal reasoning. The **TheoremLlama** framework achieves cumulative accuracies of 36.48% and 33.61% on MiniF2F-Valid and Test datasets respectively, surpassing the GPT-4 baseline of 22.95% and 25.41%. We have also open-sourced our model checkpoints and generated dataset, and will soon make all the code publicly available.",

One way of addressing these concerns is to leverage AI control systems alongside and in support of human decisions, relying on the AI control system in safe situations while calling on a human co-decider for critical situations. We extend a methodology for adversarial explanations (AE) to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning frameworks, including MuZero. Multiple improvements to the base agent architecture are proposed. We demonstrate how this technology has two applications: for intelligent decision tools and to enhance training / learning frameworks. In a decision support context, adversarial explanations help a user make the correct decision by highlighting those contextual factors that would need to change for a different AI-recommended decision. As another benefit of adversarial explanations, we show that the learned AI control system demonstrates robustness against adversarial tampering. Additionally, we supplement AE by introducing strategically similar autoencoders (SSAs) to help users identify and understand all salient factors being considered by the AI system. In a training / learning framework, this technology can improve both the AI's decisions and explanations through human interaction. Finally, to identify when AI decisions would most benefit from human oversight, we tie this combined system to our prior art on statistically verified analyses of the criticality of decisions at any point in time.",

Hitherto, deep learning-based methods employed to model hysteresis, face challenges in generalizing to novel input magnetic fields. This paper addresses the generalization challenge by proposing neural operators for modeling constitutive laws that exhibit magnetic hysteresis by learning a mapping between magnetic fields. In particular, two prominent neural operators -- deep operator network and Fourier neural operator -- are employed to predict novel first-order reversal curves and minor loops, where novel means they are not used to train the model. In addition, a rate-independent Fourier neural operator is proposed to predict material responses at sampling rates different from those used during training to incorporate the rate-independent characteristics of magnetic hysteresis. The presented numerical experiments demonstrate that neural operators efficiently model magnetic hysteresis, outperforming the traditional neural recurrent methods on various metrics and generalizing to novel magnetic fields. The findings emphasize the advantages of using neural operators for modeling hysteresis under varying magnetic conditions, underscoring their importance in characterizing magnetic material based devices.",

While prior work has proposed some architecture or data format changes to achieve length generalization, these proposals typically apply to a limited set of tasks. Building on prior scratchpad and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, we propose Turing Programs, a novel CoT strategy that decomposes an algorithmic task into steps mimicking the computation of a Turing Machine. This framework is both universal, as it can accommodate any algorithmic task, and simple, requiring only copying text from the context with small modifications. We show that by using Turing Programs, we obtain robust length generalization on a range of algorithmic tasks: addition, multiplication and in-context SGD. We then demonstrate that transformers achieve length generalization on random Turing Programs, suggesting that length generalization is possible for any algorithmic task. Finally, we theoretically prove that transformers can implement Turing Programs, constructing a simple RASP (Weiss et al.) program that simulates an arbitrary Turing machine.",

However, this comes at the expense of increased data volume and required bandwidth. To balance this trade-off, we formulate a constrained quality of experience (QoE) maximization problem in which the rebuffering time and quality variation between video frames are bounded by user and video requirements. To solve the formulated multi-user QoE maximization, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for multi-task rate adaptation and computation distribution (MTRC). The proposed MTRC approach does not rely on any predefined assumption about the environment and relies on video playback statistics (i.e., past throughput, decoding time, transmission time, etc.), video information, and the resulting performance to adjust the video bitrate and computation distribution. We train MTRC with real-world wireless network traces and 360 video datasets to obtain evaluation results in terms of the average QoE, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), rebuffering time, and quality variation. Our results indicate that the MTRC improves the users' QoE compared to state-of-the-art rate adaptation algorithm. Specifically, we show a 5.97 dB to 6.44 dB improvement in PSNR, a 1.66X to 4.23X improvement in rebuffering time, and a 4.21 dB to 4.35 dB improvement in quality variation.",

Our hypothesis is that LLMs can incorporate domain knowledge about data science and BMS into data processing and modeling, ensuring that the data-driven modeling is automated for specific requirements of different building types and control objectives, which also improves accuracy and scalability.

Object, attribute or stylistic changes can be learned from visually static datasets. On the other hand, high-quality data for action and reasoning-centric edits is scarce and has to come from entirely different sources that cover e.g. physical dynamics, temporality and spatial reasoning. To this end, we meticulously curate the AURORA Dataset (Action-Reasoning-Object-Attribute), a collection of high-quality training data, human-annotated and curated from videos and simulation engines. We focus on a key aspect of quality training data: triplets (source image, prompt, target image) contain a single meaningful visual change described by the prompt, i.e., truly minimal changes between source and target images. To demonstrate the value of our dataset, we evaluate an AURORA-finetuned model on a new expert-curated benchmark (AURORA-Bench) covering 8 diverse editing tasks. Our model significantly outperforms previous editing models as judged by human raters. For automatic evaluations, we find important flaws in previous metrics and caution their use for semantically hard editing tasks. Instead, we propose a new automatic metric that focuses on discriminative understanding.

This paper seeks to understand the conditions that foster repeated collaboration among women versus men in male-dominated settings by examining the critical role of status hierarchies. Using collaboration data on 8,232,769 computer science research teams, we found that when a woman holds the top-ranking position in a steep status hierarchy, other women on that team are more likely than men to collaborate again, as compared to when the hierarchy is flat, and compared to when men occupy the top-ranking position. In steep hierarchies, top-ranking women but not top-ranking men foster conditions in which junior women are more likely to collaborate again than junior men of similar status levels. Our research suggests that whereas status hierarchies are especially detrimental to repeated collaboration among underrepresented individuals, top-ranking women in steep status hierarchies mitigate these negative impacts between women in male-dominated settings.",

        "abstract": "Two competing paradigms exist for self-supervised learning of data representations. Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is a class of architectures in which semantically similar inputs are encoded into representations that are predictive of each other. A recent successful approach that falls under the JEPA framework is self-distillation, where an online encoder is trained to predict the output of the target encoder, sometimes using a lightweight predictor network. This is contrasted with the Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) paradigm, where an encoder and decoder are trained to reconstruct missing parts of the input in the data space rather, than its latent representation. A common motivation for using the JEPA approach over MAE is that the JEPA objective prioritizes abstract features over fine-grained pixel information (which can be unpredictable and uninformative). In this work, we seek to understand the mechanism behind this empirical observation by analyzing the training dynamics of deep linear models. We uncover a surprising mechanism: in a simplified linear setting where both approaches learn similar representations, JEPAs are biased to learn high-influence features, i.e., features characterized by having high regression coefficients. Our results point to a distinct implicit bias of predicting in latent space that may shed light on its success in practice.",

Our approach compiles a dynamic dataset that captures various interactions: replies, retweets, and mentions. To explore deeper insights, the data is subjected to sentiment analysis and keyword coding, indicating shifts in discourse over time. Our method is structured in three primary phases. Initially, R is employed for pulling data and the formation of social network datasets. Following this, the combination of Python and R is utilized for sentiment analysis and keyword coding, aiming to uncover the underlying emotional shifts and language transitions within topics of discussion. The final phase employs R to visualize the dynamic shifts within these social networks. These visualization tools highlight changes in user interactions and patterns of influence. For a practical demonstration, we analyzed conversations on X.com regarding the controversial proposal to halt AI development, focusing specifically on discussions about ChatGPT. By using keyword searches, leading voices in the debate were identified. Our analysis of sentiment and keywords revealed patterns in emotions and language, while visual tools illustrated the development of network connections and their influence. This study emphasizes the vital role of visual tools in understanding online social dynamics in the digital age.",

Recent introduction of Shapley values for individualized feature contributions, accompanied with several fast computing algorithms for predicted values, shows intriguing results. However, individualizing coefficients of determination, aka $R^2$, for each feature is challenged by the underlying quadratic losses, although these coefficients allow us to comparatively assess single feature's contribution to tree ensembles. Here we propose an efficient algorithm, Q-SHAP, that reduces the computational complexity to polynomial time when calculating Shapley values related to quadratic losses. Our extensive simulation studies demonstrate that this approach not only enhances computational efficiency but also improves estimation accuracy of feature-specific coefficients of determination.",

The paper derives the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for this model and characterizes its performance in the high-dimensional limit via the associated state evolution.

Existing work typically defines these worst-case shifts as ones that most degrade the individual-level accuracy of the model. However, when models are used to make a downstream population-level decision like the allocation of a scarce resource, individual-level accuracy may be a poor proxy for performance on the task at hand. We introduce a novel framework that employs a hierarchical model structure to identify worst-case distribution shifts in predictive resource allocation settings by capturing shifts both within and across instances of the decision problem. This task is more difficult than in standard distribution shift settings due to combinatorial interactions, where decisions depend on the joint presence of individuals in the allocation task. We show that the problem can be reformulated as a submodular optimization problem, enabling efficient approximations of worst-case loss. Applying our framework to real data, we find empirical evidence that worst-case shifts identified by one metric often significantly diverge from worst-case distributions identified by other metrics.",

We propose a Lipschitz-free cubic regularization (LF-CR) algorithm for solving the convex-concave minimax optimization problem without knowing the Lipschitz constant. It can be shown that the iteration complexity of the LF-CR algorithm to obtain an $\u03b5$-optimal solution with respect to the restricted primal-dual gap is upper bounded by $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\u03c1\\|z^0-z^*\\|^3}\u03b5)^{\\frac{2}{3}}$, where $z^0=(x^0,y^0)$ is a pair of initial points, $z^*=(x^*,y^*)$ is a pair of optimal solutions, and $\u03c1$ is the Lipschitz constant. We further propose a fully parameter-free cubic regularization (FF-CR) algorithm that does not require any parameters of the problem, including the Lipschitz constant and the upper bound of the distance from the initial point to the optimal solution. We also prove that the iteration complexity of the FF-CR algorithm to obtain an $\u03b5$-optimal solution with respect to the gradient norm is upper bounded by $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\u03c1\\|z^0-z^*\\|^2}\u03b5)^{\\frac{2}{3}}$. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of both algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed FF-CR algorithm is the first completely parameter-free second-order algorithm for solving convex-concave minimax optimization problems, and its iteration complexity is consistent with the optimal iteration complexity lower bound of existing second-order algorithms with parameters for solving convex-concave minimax problems.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models for Code (code LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various software engineering (SE) tasks, increasing the application of code LLMs in software development. Despite the success of code LLMs, there remain significant concerns about the actual capabilities and reliability of these models, \"whether these models really learn the semantics of code from the training data and leverage the learned knowledge to perform the SE tasks\". In this paper, we introduce EMPICA, a comprehensive framework designed to systematically and empirically evaluate the capabilities of code LLMs in understanding code semantics. Specifically, EMPICA systematically introduces controlled modifications/transformations into the input code and examines the models' responses. Generally, code LLMs must be robust to semantically equivalent code inputs and be sensitive to non-equivalent ones for all SE tasks. Specifically, for every SE task, given an input code snippet c and its semantic equivalent variants, code LLMs must robustly produce consistent/equivalent outputs while they are expected to generate different outputs for c and its semantic non-equivalent variants. Our experimental results on three representative code understanding tasks, including code summarization, method name prediction, and output prediction, reveal that the robustness and sensitivity of the state-of-the-art code LLMs to code transformations vary significantly across tasks and transformation operators. In addition, the code LLMs exhibit better robustness to the semantic preserving transformations than their sensitivity to the semantic non-preserving transformations. These results highlight a need to enhance the model's capabilities of understanding code semantics, especially the sensitivity property.",

However, fewer studies have been proposed to study the inductive MKGC (IMKGC) involving emerging entities unseen during training. Existing inductive approaches focus on learning textual entity representations, which neglect rich semantic information in visual modality. Moreover, they focus on aggregating structural neighbors from existing KGs, which of emerging entities are usually limited. However, the semantic neighbors are decoupled from the topology linkage and usually imply the true target entity. In this paper, we propose the IMKGC task and a semantic neighbor retrieval-enhanced IMKGC framework CMR, where the contrast brings the helpful semantic neighbors close, and then the memorize supports semantic neighbor retrieval to enhance inference. Specifically, we first propose a unified cross-modal contrastive learning to simultaneously capture the textual-visual and textual-textual correlations of query-entity pairs in a unified representation space. The contrastive learning increases the similarity of positive query-entity pairs, therefore making the representations of helpful semantic neighbors close. Then, we explicitly memorize the knowledge representations to support the semantic neighbor retrieval. At test time, we retrieve the nearest semantic neighbors and interpolate them to the query-entity similarity distribution to augment the final prediction. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CMR on three inductive MKGC datasets. Codes are available at https://github.com/OreOZhao/CMR.",

Most anomaly detection approaches using defect detection datasets, such as MVTec AD, employ one-class models that require fitting separate models for each class. On the contrary, unified models eliminate the need for fitting separate models for each class and significantly reduce cost and memory requirements. Thus, in this work, we experiment with considering a unified multi-class setup. Our experimental study shows that multi-class models perform at par with one-class models for the standard MVTec AD dataset. Hence, this indicates that there may not be a need to learn separate object/class-wise models when the object classes are significantly different from each other, as is the case of the dataset considered. Furthermore, we have deployed three different unified lightweight architectures on the CPU and an edge device (NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX). We analyze the quantized multi-class anomaly detection models in terms of latency and memory requirements for deployment on the edge device while comparing quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) for performance at different precision widths. In addition, we explored two different methods of calibration required in post-training scenarios and show that one of them performs notably better, highlighting its importance for unsupervised tasks. Due to quantization, the performance drop in PTQ is further compensated by QAT, which yields at par performance with the original 32-bit Floating point in two of the models considered.",

To address this, we introduce a feasible framework in which clients collaboratively train a binary selector with their preference datasets using our proposed FedBis. With a well-trained selector, we can further enhance the LLM that generates human-preferred completions. Meanwhile, we propose a novel algorithm, FedBiscuit, that trains multiple selectors by organizing clients into balanced and disjoint clusters based on their preferences. Compared to the FedBis, FedBiscuit demonstrates superior performance in simulating human preferences for pairwise completions.

In this paper we propose a method for determining the (x, y) coordinates on the field and the height h of the camera from the geometry of a simplified tetrahedron. This configuration is formed by two observed points on the ground plane plus the gravitational direction. When the distance between the two points is known, and the directions to the points plus the gravitational direction are measured, all dimensions of the tetrahedron can be determined. By performing these calculations with rational trigonometry instead of classical trigonometry, the computations turn out to be 28.7% faster, with equal numerical accuracy. The position of the head of the Nao can also be externally measured with the OptiTrack system. The difference between externally measured and internally predicted position from sensor data gives us mean absolute errors in the 3-6 centimeters range, when we estimated the gravitational direction from the vanishing point of the outer edges of the goal posts.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention but also raised concerns due to the risk of misuse. Jailbreak prompts, a popular type of adversarial attack towards LLMs, have appeared and constantly evolved to breach the safety protocols of LLMs. To address this issue, LLMs are regularly updated with safety patches based on reported jailbreak prompts. However, malicious users often keep their successful jailbreak prompts private to exploit LLMs. To uncover these private jailbreak prompts, extensive analysis of large-scale conversational datasets is necessary to identify prompts that still manage to bypass the system's defenses. This task is highly challenging due to the immense volume of conversation data, diverse characteristics of jailbreak prompts, and their presence in complex multi-turn conversations. To tackle these challenges, we introduce JailbreakHunter, a visual analytics approach for identifying jailbreak prompts in large-scale human-LLM conversational datasets. We have designed a workflow with three analysis levels: group-level, conversation-level, and turn-level. Group-level analysis enables users to grasp the distribution of conversations and identify suspicious conversations using multiple criteria, such as similarity with reported jailbreak prompts in previous research and attack success rates. Conversation-level analysis facilitates the understanding of the progress of conversations and helps discover jailbreak prompts within their conversation contexts. Turn-level analysis allows users to explore the semantic similarity and token overlap between a singleturn prompt and the reported jailbreak prompts, aiding in the identification of new jailbreak strategies. The effectiveness and usability of the system were verified through multiple case studies and expert interviews.",

        "abstract": "Adversarial examples have shown a powerful ability to make a well-trained model misclassified. Current mainstream adversarial attack methods only consider one of the distortions among $L_0$-norm, $L_2$-norm, and $L_\\infty$-norm. $L_0$-norm based methods cause large modification on a single pixel, resulting in naked-eye visible detection, while $L_2$-norm and $L_\\infty$-norm based methods suffer from weak robustness against adversarial defense since they always diffuse tiny perturbations to all pixels. A more realistic adversarial perturbation should be sparse and imperceptible. In this paper, we propose a novel $L_p$-norm distortion-efficient adversarial attack, which not only owns the least $L_2$-norm loss but also significantly reduces the $L_0$-norm distortion. To this aim, we design a new optimization scheme, which first optimizes an initial adversarial perturbation under $L_2$-norm constraint, and then constructs a dimension unimportance matrix for the initial perturbation. Such a dimension unimportance matrix can indicate the adversarial unimportance of each dimension of the initial perturbation. Furthermore, we introduce a new concept of adversarial threshold for the dimension unimportance matrix. The dimensions of the initial perturbation whose unimportance is higher than the threshold will be all set to zero, greatly decreasing the $L_0$-norm distortion. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that under the same query budget, the adversarial examples generated by our method have lower $L_0$-norm and $L_2$-norm distortion than the state-of-the-art. Especially for the MNIST dataset, our attack reduces 8.1$\\%$ $L_2$-norm distortion meanwhile remaining 47$\\%$ pixels unattacked. This demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over its competitors in terms of adversarial robustness and visual imperceptibility.",

However, some open-source LLMs require approval before usage, which has led to third parties publishing their own easily accessible versions. Similarly, third parties have been publishing fine-tuned or quantized variants of these LLMs. These versions are particularly appealing to users because of their ease of access and reduced computational resource demands. This trend has increased the risk of training time attacks, compromising the integrity and security of LLMs. In this work, we present a new training time attack, SOS, which is designed to be low in computational demand and does not require clean data or modification of the model weights, thereby maintaining the model's utility intact. The attack addresses security issues in various scenarios, including the backdoor attack, jailbreak attack, and prompt stealing attack. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed attack is effective across all evaluated targets. Furthermore, we present the other side of our SOS technique, namely the copyright token -- a novel technique that enables users to mark their copyrighted content and prevent models from using it.",

Taking as input a point cloud with randomly oriented normals, we optimize this energy to restore the global harmonicity of the GWN field, thereby recovering the globally consistent normals.

Most previous 3D segmentation approaches are specialized for a specific task, thereby limiting their understanding of 3D scenes to a task-specific perspective. In contrast, the proposed method unifies six tasks into unified representations processed by the same Transformer. It facilitates inter-task knowledge sharing and, therefore, promotes comprehensive 3D scene understanding. To take advantage of multi-task unification, we enhance the performance by leveraging task connections. Specifically, we design a knowledge distillation method and a contrastive learning method to transfer task-specific knowledge across different tasks. Benefiting from extensive inter-task knowledge sharing, our UniSeg3D becomes more powerful. Experiments on three benchmarks, including the ScanNet20, ScanRefer, and ScanNet200, demonstrate that the UniSeg3D consistently outperforms current SOTA methods, even those specialized for individual tasks.

However, encoding a complex, potentially multimodal data distribution into a single continuous Gaussian distribution arguably represents an unnecessarily challenging learning problem. We propose Discrete-Continuous Latent Variable Diffusion Models (DisCo-Diff) to simplify this task by introducing complementary discrete latent variables. We augment DMs with learnable discrete latents, inferred with an encoder, and train DM and encoder end-to-end. DisCo-Diff does not rely on pre-trained networks, making the framework universally applicable. The discrete latents significantly simplify learning the DM's complex noise-to-data mapping by reducing the curvature of the DM's generative ODE. An additional autoregressive transformer models the distribution of the discrete latents, a simple step because DisCo-Diff requires only few discrete variables with small codebooks. We validate DisCo-Diff on toy data, several image synthesis tasks as well as molecular docking, and find that introducing discrete latents consistently improves model performance. For example, DisCo-Diff achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on class-conditioned ImageNet-64/128 datasets with ODE sampler.",

Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated tasks such as object detection or text recognition, CoMix addresses a broader range of tasks including object detection, speaker identification, character re-identification, reading order, and multi-modal reasoning tasks like character naming and dialogue generation. Our benchmark comprises three existing datasets with expanded annotations to support multi-task evaluation. To mitigate the over-representation of manga-style data, we have incorporated a new dataset of carefully selected American comic-style books, thereby enriching the diversity of comic styles. CoMix is designed to assess pre-trained models in zero-shot and limited fine-tuning settings, probing their transfer capabilities across different comic styles and tasks. The validation split of the benchmark is publicly available for research purposes, and an evaluation server for the held-out test split is also provided. Comparative results between human performance and state-of-the-art models reveal a significant performance gap, highlighting substantial opportunities for advancements in comic understanding.

In response, Domain Generalization techniques aim to enhance model robustness by simulating novel data distributions during training, typically through various augmentation or stylization strategies. However, these methods frequently suffer from limited control over the diversity of generated images and lack assurance that these images span distinct distributions. To address these challenges, we propose FDS, a novel strategy that employs diffusion models to synthesize samples from new domains by training on source distribution samples and performing domain mixing. By incorporating images that pose classification challenges to models trained on original samples, alongside the original dataset, we ensure the generation of a training set that spans a broad distribution spectrum. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that this methodology sets new benchmarks in domain generalization performance across a range of challenging datasets, effectively managing diverse types of domain shifts.

Using text-guided inpainting models, our approach ensures protected group independence from all attributes and mitigates inpainting biases through data filtering. Evaluations on multi-label image classification and image captioning tasks show our method effectively reduces bias without compromising performance across various models.",

        "abstract": "Gait recognition, which aims at identifying individuals by their walking patterns, has achieved great success based on silhouette. The binary silhouette sequence encodes the walking pattern within the sparse boundary representation. Therefore, most pixels in the silhouette are under-sensitive to the walking pattern since the sparse boundary lacks dense spatial-temporal information, which is suitable to be represented with dense texture. To enhance the sensitivity to the walking pattern while maintaining the robustness of recognition, we present a Complementary Learning with neural Architecture Search (CLASH) framework, consisting of walking pattern sensitive gait descriptor named dense spatial-temporal field (DSTF) and neural architecture search based complementary learning (NCL). Specifically, DSTF transforms the representation from the sparse binary boundary into the dense distance-based texture, which is sensitive to the walking pattern at the pixel level. Further, NCL presents a task-specific search space for complementary learning, which mutually complements the sensitivity of DSTF and the robustness of the silhouette to represent the walking pattern effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods under both in-the-lab and in-the-wild scenarios. On CASIA-B, we achieve rank-1 accuracy of 98.8%, 96.5%, and 89.3% under three conditions. On OU-MVLP, we achieve rank-1 accuracy of 91.9%. Under the latest in-the-wild datasets, we outperform the latest silhouette-based methods by 16.3% and 19.7% on Gait3D and GREW, respectively.",

We explore the performance disparity that arises when models are applied to incomplete data typical in real-world, real-time network environments. Our findings demonstrate a significant decline in model performance, with precision and recall dropping by up to 30\\% under certain conditions when models trained on complete flows are tested against partial flows. Conversely, models trained and tested on consistently complete or partial datasets maintain robustness, highlighting the importance of dataset consistency in training. The study reveals that a minimum of 7 packets in the test set is required for maintaining reliable detection rates. These results underscore the need for tailored training strategies that can effectively adapt to the dynamics of partial data, enhancing the practical applicability of anomaly detection systems in operational settings.",

Given FEEL's limited communication resources and potential mislabeled data on devices, improper resource allocation or data selection can hurt convergence speed and increase training costs. Thus, to realize an efficient FEEL system, this paper emphasizes jointly optimizing resource allocation and data selection. Specifically, in this work, through rigorously modeling the training process and deriving an upper bound on FEEL's one-round convergence rate, we establish a problem of joint resource allocation and data selection, which, unfortunately, cannot be solved directly. Toward this end, we equivalently transform the original problem into a solvable form via a variable substitution and then break it into two subproblems, that is, the resource allocation problem and the data selection problem. The two subproblems are mixed-integer non-convex and integer non-convex problems, respectively, and achieving their optimal solutions is a challenging task. Based on the matching theory and applying the convex-concave procedure and gradient projection methods, we devise a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm for the two subproblems, respectively. Finally, the superiority of our proposed scheme of joint resource allocation and data selection is validated by numerical results.",

Additionally, we enhance convolution efficiency by introducing correction terms to convert invalid circular convolution outputs of the Fourier method into effective ones. The numerical error analysis is presented for the first time in this type of work and proves that our algorithms can provide a 3.68x multiplication reduction for 3x3 convolution, while the Winograd algorithm only achieves a 2.25x reduction with similarly low numerical errors. Experiments carried out on benchmarks and FPGA show that our new algorithms can further improve the computation efficiency of quantized models while maintaining accuracy, surpassing both the quantization-alone method and existing works on fast convolution quantization.",

This approach aligns the feature spaces of heterogeneous model layers and resolves per-layer information disparity during weight aggregation. To practically realize HypeMeFed, we also propose a low-rank factorization approach to minimize computation and memory overhead associated with hypernetworks. Our evaluations on a real-world heterogeneous device testbed indicate that HypeMeFed enhances accuracy by 5.12% over FedAvg, reduces the hypernetwork memory requirements by 98.22%, and accelerates its operations by 1.86 times compared to a naive hypernetwork approach.

To achieve this, GFlowNets can be trained with various objectives, each of which can lead to the model s ultimate goal. The aspirational strength of GFlowNets lies in their potential to discern intricate patterns within the reward function and their capacity to generalize effectively to novel, unseen parts of the reward function. This paper attempts to formalize generalization in the context of GFlowNets, to link generalization with stability, and also to design experiments that assess the capacity of these models to uncover unseen parts of the reward function.

This work introduces value-penalized auxiliary control from examples (VPACE); we significantly improve exploration in example-based control by adding scheduled auxiliary control and examples of auxiliary tasks. Furthermore, we identify a value-calibration problem, where policy value estimates can exceed their theoretical limits based on successful data. We resolve this problem, which is exacerbated by learning auxiliary tasks, through the addition of an above-success-level value penalty. Across three simulated and one real robotic manipulation environment, and 21 different main tasks, we show that our approach substantially improves learning efficiency.

Such libraries are crucial for scientific discovery, but it remains challenging to generate large numbers of high quality samples efficiently. 3D-voxel-based methods have recently shown great promise for generating high quality samples de novo from random noise (Pinheiro et al., 2023). However, sampling in 3D-voxel space is computationally expensive and use in library generation is prohibitively slow. Here, we instead perform neural empirical Bayes sampling (Saremi & Hyvarinen, 2019) in the learned latent space of a vector-quantized variational autoencoder. NEBULA generates large molecular libraries nearly an order of magnitude faster than existing methods without sacrificing sample quality. Moreover, NEBULA generalizes better to unseen drug-like molecules, as demonstrated on two public datasets and multiple recently released drugs. We expect the approach herein to be highly enabling for machine learning-based drug discovery. The code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/nebula",

        "abstract": "The environments where individuals live can present diverse navigation challenges, resulting in varying navigation abilities and strategies. Inspired by differing urban layouts and the Dual Solutions Paradigm test used for human navigators, we developed a simulated navigation environment to train deep reinforcement learning agents in a shortcut usage task. We modulated the frequency of exposure to a shortcut and navigation cue, leading to the development of artificial agents with differing abilities. We examined the encoded representations in artificial neural networks driving these agents, revealing intricate dynamics in representation learning, and correlated them with shortcut use preferences. Furthermore, we demonstrated methods to analyze representations across a population of nodes, which proved effective in finding patterns in what would otherwise be noisy single-node data. These techniques may also have broader applications in studying neural activity. From our observations in representation learning dynamics, we propose insights for human navigation learning, emphasizing the importance of navigation challenges in developing strong landmark knowledge over repeated exposures to landmarks alone.",

        "abstract": "The overwhelming success of GPT-4 in early 2023 highlighted the transformative potential of large language models (LLMs) across various sectors, including national security. This article explores the implications of LLM integration within national security contexts, analyzing their potential to revolutionize information processing, decision-making, and operational efficiency. Whereas LLMs offer substantial benefits, such as automating tasks and enhancing data analysis, they also pose significant risks, including hallucinations, data privacy concerns, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Through their coupling with decision-theoretic principles and Bayesian reasoning, LLMs can significantly improve decision-making processes within national security organizations. Namely, LLMs can facilitate the transition from data to actionable decisions, enabling decision-makers to quickly receive and distill available information with less manpower. Current applications within the US Department of Defense and beyond are explored, e.g., the USAF's use of LLMs for wargaming and automatic summarization, that illustrate their potential to streamline operations and support decision-making. However, these applications necessitate rigorous safeguards to ensure accuracy and reliability. The broader implications of LLM integration extend to strategic planning, international relations, and the broader geopolitical landscape, with adversarial nations leveraging LLMs for disinformation and cyber operations, emphasizing the need for robust countermeasures. Despite exhibiting \"sparks\" of artificial general intelligence, LLMs are best suited for supporting roles rather than leading strategic decisions. Their use in training and wargaming can provide valuable insights and personalized learning experiences for military personnel, thereby improving operational readiness.",

        "abstract": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) stands as a powerful approach in weakly supervised learning, regularly employed in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification for detecting tumorous lesions. However, existing mainstream MIL methods focus on modeling correlation between instances while overlooking the inherent diversity among instances. However, few MIL methods have aimed at diversity modeling, which empirically show inferior performance but with a high computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel MIL aggregation method based on diverse global representation (DGR-MIL), by modeling diversity among instances through a set of global vectors that serve as a summary of all instances. First, we turn the instance correlation into the similarity between instance embeddings and the predefined global vectors through a cross-attention mechanism. This stems from the fact that similar instance embeddings typically would result in a higher correlation with a certain global vector. Second, we propose two mechanisms to enforce the diversity among the global vectors to be more descriptive of the entire bag: (i) positive instance alignment and (ii) a novel, efficient, and theoretically guaranteed diversification learning paradigm. Specifically, the positive instance alignment module encourages the global vectors to align with the center of positive instances (e.g., instances containing tumors in WSI). To further diversify the global representations, we propose a novel diversification learning paradigm leveraging the determinantal point process. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL aggregation models by a substantial margin on the CAMELYON-16 and the TCGA-lung cancer datasets.

While collaborative learning (e.g., federated learning) provides a promising paradigm to harness collective data from many participants, training large models remains a major challenge for participants with limited resources like mobile devices. We introduce MSfusion, an effective and efficient collaborative learning framework, tailored for training larger models on resourceconstraint machines through model splitting. Specifically, a double shifting model splitting scheme is designed such that in each training round, each participant is assigned a subset of model parameters to train over local data, and aggregates with sub-models of other peers on common parameters. While model splitting significantly reduces the computation and communication costs of individual participants, additional novel designs on adaptive model overlapping and contrastive loss functions help MSfusion to maintain training effectiveness, against model shift across participants. Extensive experiments on image and NLP tasks illustrate significant advantages of MSfusion in performance and efficiency for training large models, and its strong scalability: computation cost of each participant reduces significantly as the number of participants increases.",

Specifically, we compare the effectiveness of scenario superposition to that of the previous most likely scenario detection method. Additionally, how the length of the observation time window influences the accuracy of both methods is analyzed. We utilize an existing database comprising 1771 tsunami scenarios targeting the city Westport (WA, U.S.), which includes synthetic wave height records and inundation distributions as the result of fault rupture in the Cascadia subduction zone. The heterogeneous patterns of slips used in the database increase the diversity of the scenarios and thus make it a proper database for evaluating the performance of scenario superposition. To assess the performance, we consider various observation time windows shorter than 15 minutes and divide the database into five testing and learning sets. The evaluation accuracy of the maximum offshore wave, inundation depth, and its distribution is analyzed to examine the advantages of the scenario superposition method over the previous method. We introduce the dynamic time warping (DTW) method as an additional benchmark and compare its results to that of the Bayesian scenario detection method.",

Though tremendous strides have been made in feature alignment between satellite and drone views, vast differences in both inter and intra-class due to changes in viewpoint, altitude, and lighting remain a huge challenge. In this paper, a style alignment based dynamic observation method for UAV-view geo-localization is proposed to meet the above challenges from two perspectives: visual style transformation and surrounding noise control. Specifically, we introduce a style alignment strategy to transfrom the diverse visual style of drone-view images into a unified satellite images visual style. Then a dynamic observation module is designed to evaluate the spatial distribution of images by mimicking human observation habits. It is featured by the hierarchical attention block (HAB) with a dual-square-ring stream structure, to reduce surrounding noise and geographical deformation. In addition, we propose a deconstruction loss to push away features of different geo-tags and squeeze knowledge from unmatched images by correlation calculation. The experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our model on benchmarked datasets. In particular, when compared to the prior art on University-1652, our results surpass the best of them (FSRA), while only requiring 2x fewer parameters.

In this work, our proposed effective strategy LANE aligns LLMs with online recommendation systems without additional LLMs tuning, reducing costs and improving explainability. This innovative approach addresses key challenges in integrating language models with recommendation systems while fully utilizing the capabilities of powerful proprietary models. Specifically, our strategy operates through several key components: semantic embedding, user multi-preference extraction using zero-shot prompting, semantic alignment, and explainable recommendation generation using Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting. By embedding item titles instead of IDs and utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms, our approach aligns the semantic features of user preferences with those of candidate items, ensuring coherent and user-aligned recommendations. Sufficient experimental results including performance comparison, questionnaire voting, and visualization cases prove that our method can not only ensure recommendation performance, but also provide easy-to-understand and reasonable recommendation logic.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer poses a profound threat to lives globally, claiming numerous lives each year. Therefore, timely detection is crucial for early intervention and improved chances of survival. Accurately diagnosing and classifying breast tumors using ultrasound images is a persistent challenge in medicine, demanding cutting-edge solutions for improved treatment strategies. This research introduces multiattention-enhanced deep learning (DL) frameworks designed for the classification and segmentation of breast cancer tumors from ultrasound images. A spatial channel attention mechanism is proposed for segmenting tumors from ultrasound images, utilizing a novel LinkNet DL framework with an InceptionResNet backbone. Following this, the paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network with an integrated multi-attention framework (DCNNIMAF) to classify the segmented tumor as benign, malignant, or normal. From experimental results, it is observed that the segmentation model has recorded an accuracy of 98.1%, with a minimal loss of 0.6%. It has also achieved high Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient scores of 96.9% and 97.2%, respectively. Similarly, the classification model has attained an accuracy of 99.2%, with a low loss of 0.31%. Furthermore, the classification framework has achieved outstanding F1-Score, precision, and recall values of 99.1%, 99.3%, and 99.1%, respectively. By offering a robust framework for early detection and accurate classification of breast cancer, this proposed work significantly advances the field of medical image analysis, potentially improving diagnostic precision and patient outcomes.",

An important observation is that, while different types of jailbreak attacks can generate significantly different queries, they mostly result in similar responses that are rooted in the same harmful knowledge (e.g., detailed steps to make a bomb). Therefore, we conjecture that directly unlearn the harmful knowledge in the LLM can be a more effective way to defend against jailbreak attacks than the mainstream supervised fine-tuning (SFT) based approaches. Our extensive experiments confirmed our insight and suggested surprising generalizability of our unlearning-based approach: using only 20 raw harmful questions \\emph{without} any jailbreak prompt during training, our solution reduced the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in Vicuna-7B on \\emph{out-of-distribution} (OOD) harmful questions wrapped with various complex jailbreak prompts from 82.6\\% to 7.7\\%. This significantly outperforms Llama2-7B-Chat, which is fine-tuned on about 0.1M safety alignment samples but still has an ASR of 21.9\\% even under the help of an additional safety system prompt. Further analysis reveals that the generalization ability of our solution stems from the intrinsic relatedness among harmful responses across harmful questions (e.g., response patterns, shared steps and actions, and similarity among their learned representations in the LLM).

Recent works have shown a great potential in exploiting KG embeddings for the task of EA, with most works focusing on the structural representation of entities (i.e., entity neighborhoods) in a KG and some works also exploiting the available factual information of entities (e.g., their names and associated literal values). However, real-word KGs exhibit high levels of structural and semantic heterogeneity, making EA a challenging task in which most existing methods struggle to achieve good results.

Since retinal diseases are so complicated, retinal imaging is likely to show two or more abnormalities. Current deep learning techniques for segmenting retinal images with many labels and attributes have poor detection accuracy and generalisability. This paper presents a multipath convolutional neural network for multifeature segmentation. The proposed network is lightweight and spatially sensitive to information. A patch-based implementation is used to extract local image features, and focal modulation attention blocks are incorporated between the encoder and the decoder for improved segmentation. Filter optimisation is used to prevent filter overlaps and speed up model convergence. A combination of convolution operations and group convolution operations is used to reduce computational costs. This is the first robust and generalisable network capable of segmenting multiple features of fundus images (including retinal vessels, microaneurysms, optic discs, haemorrhages, hard exudates, and soft exudates). The results of our experimental evaluation on more than ten publicly available datasets with multiple features show that the proposed network outperforms recent networks despite having a small number of learnable parameters.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots, becoming increasingly autonomous, are capable of operating in diverse and unknown environments. This flexibility allows them to fulfill goals independently and adapting their actions dynamically without rigidly predefined control codes. However, their autonomous behavior complicates guaranteeing safety and reliability due to the limited influence of a human operator to accurately supervise and verify each robot's actions. To ensure autonomous mobile robot's safety and reliability, which are aspects of dependability, methods are needed both in the planning and execution of missions for autonomous mobile robots. In this article, a twofold approach is presented that ensures fault removal in the context of mission planning and fault prevention during mission execution for autonomous mobile robots. First, the approach consists of a concept based on formal verification applied during the planning phase of missions. Second, the approach consists of a rule-based concept applied during mission execution. A use case applying the approach is presented, discussing how the two concepts complement each other and what contribution they make to certain aspects of dependability. Unbemannte Fahrzeuge sind durch zunehmende Autonomie in der Lage in unterschiedlichen unbekannten Umgebungen zu operieren. Diese Flexibilit\u00e4t erm\u00f6glicht es ihnen Ziele eigenst\u00e4ndig zu erf\u00fcllen und ihre Handlungen dynamisch anzupassen ohne starr vorgegebenen Steuerungscode. Allerdings erschwert ihr autonomes Verhalten die Gew\u00e4hrleistung von Sicherheit und Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeit, bzw. der Verl\u00e4sslichkeit, da der Einfluss eines menschlichen Bedieners zur genauen \u00dcberwachung und Verifizierung der Aktionen jedes Roboters begrenzt ist.

        "abstract": "Deep learning models have exhibited remarkable efficacy in accurately delineating the prostate for diagnosis and treatment of prostate diseases, but challenges persist in achieving robust generalization across different medical centers. Source-free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is a promising technique to adapt deep segmentation models to address privacy and security concerns while reducing domain shifts between source and target domains. However, recent literature indicates that the performance of SFDA remains far from satisfactory due to unpredictable domain gaps. Annotating a few target domain samples is acceptable, as it can lead to significant performance improvement with a low annotation cost. Nevertheless, due to extremely limited annotation budgets, careful consideration is needed in selecting samples for annotation. Inspired by this, our goal is to develop Active Source-free Domain Adaptation (ASFDA) for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we propose a novel Uncertainty-guided Tiered Self-training (UGTST) framework, consisting of efficient active sample selection via entropy-based primary local peak filtering to aggregate global uncertainty and diversity-aware redundancy filter, coupled with a tiered self-learning strategy, achieves stable domain adaptation. Experimental results on cross-center prostate MRI segmentation datasets revealed that our method yielded marked advancements, with a mere 5% annotation, exhibiting an average Dice score enhancement of 9.78% and 7.58% in two target domains compared with state-of-the-art methods, on par with fully supervised learning.

The Matching Cut problem asks if a graph has a matching cut. This problem, and its generalization d-cut, has drawn considerable attention of the algorithms and complexity community in the last decade, becoming a canonical example for parameterized enumeration algorithms and kernelization. In this paper, we introduce and study a generalization of Matching Cut, which we have named Matching Multicut: can we partition the vertex set of a graph in at least $\\ell$ parts such that no vertex has more than one neighbor outside its part? We investigate this question in several settings. We start by showing that, contrary to Matching Cut, it is NP-hard on cubic graphs but that, when $\\ell$ is a parameter, it admits a quasi-linear kernel. We also show an $O(\\ell^{\\frac{n}{2}})$ time exact exponential algorithm for general graphs and a $2^{O(t \\log t)}n^{O(1)}$ time algorithm for graphs of treewidth at most $t$. We then study parameterized enumeration aspects of matching multicuts. First, we generalize the quadratic kernel of Golovach et. al for Enum Matching Cut parameterized by vertex cover, then use it to design a quadratic kernel for Enum Matching (Multi)cut parameterized by vertex-deletion distance to co-cluster. Our final contributions are on the vertex-deletion distance to cluster parameterization, where we show an FPT-delay algorithm for Enum Matching Multicut but that no polynomial kernel exists unless NP $\\subseteq$ coNP/poly; we highlight that we have no such lower bound for Enum Matching Cut and consider it our main open question.",

Traditional mitigation strategies in this field such as data augmentation and stain color normalization have proven insufficient in addressing this limitation, necessitating the exploration of alternative methodologies. To this end, we propose a novel generative method for domain generalization in histopathology images. Our method employs a generative, self-supervised Vision Transformer to dynamically extract characteristics of image patches and seamlessly infuse them into the original images, thereby creating novel, synthetic images with diverse attributes. By enriching the dataset with such synthesized images, we aim to enhance its holistic nature, facilitating improved generalization of DL models to unseen domains. Extensive experiments conducted on two distinct histopathology datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, outperforming the state of the art substantially, on the Camelyon17-wilds challenge dataset (+2%) and on a second epithelium-stroma dataset (+26%). Furthermore, we emphasize our method's ability to readily scale with increasingly available unlabeled data samples and more complex, higher parametric architectures.

        "abstract": "Pre-trained foundation models (FMs), with extensive number of neurons, are key to advancing next-generation intelligence services, where personalizing these models requires massive amount of task-specific data and computational resources. The prevalent solution involves centralized processing at the edge server, which, however, raises privacy concerns due to the transmission of raw data. Instead, federated fine-tuning (FedFT) is an emerging privacy-preserving fine-tuning (FT) paradigm for personalized pre-trained foundation models. In particular, by integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning (FL), federated LoRA enables the collaborative FT of a global model with edge devices, achieving comparable learning performance to full FT while training fewer parameters over distributed data and preserving raw data privacy. However, the limited radio resources and computation capabilities of edge devices pose significant challenges for deploying federated LoRA over wireless networks. To this paper, we propose a split federated LoRA framework, which deploys the computationally-intensive encoder of a pre-trained model at the edge server, while keeping the embedding and task modules at the edge devices. Building on this split framework, the paper provides a rigorous analysis of the upper bound of the convergence gap for the wireless federated LoRA system. This analysis motivates the formulation of a long-term upper bound minimization problem, where we decompose the formulated long-term mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem into sequential sub-problems using the Lyapunov technique. We then develop an online algorithm for effective device scheduling and bandwidth allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed online algorithm in enhancing learning performance.",

Compared to configurations that only utilize a single camera technology, cross-modal patterns can be recorded that allow a more comprehensive assessment of plant phenotypes. However, the effective utilization of cross-modal patterns is dependent on precise image registration to achieve pixel-accurate alignment, a challenge often complicated by parallax and occlusion effects inherent in plant canopy imaging. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal 3D image registration method that addresses these challenges by integrating depth information from a time-of-flight camera into the registration process. By leveraging depth data, our method mitigates parallax effects and thus facilitates more accurate pixel alignment across camera modalities. Additionally, we introduce an automated mechanism to identify and differentiate different types of occlusions, thereby minimizing the introduction of registration errors. To evaluate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct experiments on a diverse image dataset comprising six distinct plant species with varying leaf geometries. Our results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed registration algorithm, showcasing its ability to achieve accurate alignment across different plant types and camera compositions. Compared to previous methods it is not reliant on detecting plant specific image features and can thereby be utilized for a wide variety of applications in plant sciences. The registration approach principally scales to arbitrary numbers of cameras with different resolutions and wavelengths. Overall, our study contributes to advancing the field of plant phenotyping by offering a robust and reliable solution for multimodal image registration.",

Specifically, we consider the following problem: given an edge-weighted graph, find a minimum-weight spanning tree among those containing a perfect matching. On the positive side, we design a simple greedy algorithm for the case when the graph is complete (or complete bipartite) and the edge weights take at most two values. On the negative side, the problem is NP-hard even when the graph is complete (or complete bipartite) and the edge weights take at most three values, or when the graph is cubic, planar, and bipartite and the edge weights take at most two values. We also consider an interesting variant. We call a tree strongly balanced if on one side of the bipartition of the vertex set with respect to the tree, all but one of the vertices have degree $2$ and the remaining one is a leaf. This property is a sufficient condition for a tree to have a perfect matching, which enjoys an additional property. When the underlying graph is bipartite, strongly balanced spanning trees can be written as matroid intersection, and this fact was recently utilized to design an approximation algorithm for some kind of connectivity augmentation problem. The natural question is its tractability in nonbipartite graphs. As a negative answer, it turns out NP-hard to test whether a given graph has a strongly balanced spanning tree or not even when the graph is subcubic and planar.",

In the problem, we are given a graph with prizes on the nodes and lengths on the edges, together with a budget on the overall tour length. The goal is to find a tour that respects the length budget and maximizes the collected prizes. In this work, we introduce the orienteering interdiction game, in which a competitor (the leader) tries to minimize the total prize that the follower can collect within a feasible tour. To this end, the leader interdicts some of the nodes so that the follower cannot collect their prizes. The resulting interdiction game is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem, and a single-level reformulation is obtained based on interdiction cuts. A branch-and-cut algorithm with several enhancements, including the use of a solution pool, a cut pool and a heuristic method for the follower's problem, is proposed. In addition to this exact approach, a genetic algorithm is developed to obtain high-quality solutions in a short computing time. In a computational study based on instances from the literature for the orienteering problem, the usefulness of the proposed algorithmic components is assessed, and the branch-and-cut and genetic algorithms are compared in terms of solution time and quality.",

Traditional motion correction methods often fail to address severe motion, leading to distorted and unreliable results. Deep Learning (DL) alleviated such pitfalls through generalization with the cost of vanishing structures and hallucinations, making it challenging to apply in the medical field where hallucinated structures can tremendously impact the diagnostic outcome. In this work, we present an instance-wise motion correction pipeline that leverages motion-guided Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to mitigate the impact of motion artifacts while retaining anatomical structure. Our method is evaluated using the NYU fastMRI dataset with different degrees of simulated motion severity. For the correction alone, we can improve over state-of-the-art image reconstruction methods by $+5\\%$ SSIM, $+5\\:db$ PSNR, and $+14\\%$ HaarPSI. Clinical relevance is demonstrated by a subsequent experiment, where our method improves classification outcomes by at least $+1.5$ accuracy percentage points compared to motion-corrupted images.",

GNN-based methods and Transformer-based methods have become mainstream architectures due to their advanced spatial and temporal feature learning capacities. However, existing approaches typically construct joint-wise and frame-wise attention alignments in spatial and temporal domains, resulting in dense connections that introduce considerable local redundancy and computational overhead. In this paper, we take a global approach to exploit spatio-temporal information and realise efficient 3D HPE with a concise Graph and Skipped Transformer architecture. Specifically, in Spatial Encoding stage, coarse-grained body parts are deployed to construct Spatial Graph Network with a fully data-driven adaptive topology, ensuring model flexibility and generalizability across various poses. In Temporal Encoding and Decoding stages, a simple yet effective Skipped Transformer is proposed to capture long-range temporal dependencies and implement hierarchical feature aggregation. A straightforward Data Rolling strategy is also developed to introduce dynamic information into 2D pose sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted on Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and Human-Eva benchmarks. G-SFormer series methods achieve superior performances compared with previous state-of-the-arts with only around ten percent of parameters and significantly reduced computational complexity. Additionally, G-SFormer also exhibits outstanding robustness to inaccuracies in detected 2D poses.",

However, their potential application in clinical practice requires evaluation in domain-specific tasks, where benchmarks are largely missing. In this study semioLLM, we test the ability of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mixtral 8x7B, and Qwen-72chat) to leverage their internal knowledge and reasoning for epilepsy diagnosis. Specifically, we obtain likelihood estimates linking unstructured text descriptions of seizures to seizure-generating brain regions, using an annotated clinical database containing 1269 entries. We evaluate the LLM's performance, confidence, reasoning, and citation abilities in comparison to clinical evaluation. Models achieve above-chance classification performance with prompt engineering significantly improving their outcome, with some models achieving close-to-clinical performance and reasoning. However, our analyses also reveal significant pitfalls with several models being overly confident while showing poor performance, as well as exhibiting citation errors and hallucinations. In summary, our work provides the first extensive benchmark comparing current SOTA LLMs in the medical domain of epilepsy and highlights their ability to leverage unstructured texts from patients' medical history to aid diagnostic processes in health care.",

Identification of device dependencies determines whether a pair of IP addresses is a dependency, i.e., the host with the first IP address is dependent on the second one. These dependencies cannot be identified manually in large and dynamically changing networks. Nevertheless, they are important due to possible unexpected failures, performance issues, and cascading effects. We address the identification of dependencies using a new approach based on graph-based machine learning. The approach belongs to link prediction based on a latent representation of the computer network's communication graph. It samples random walks over IP addresses that fulfill time conditions imposed on network dependencies. The constrained random walks are used by a neural network to construct IP address embedding, which is a space that contains IP addresses that often appear close together in the same communication chain (i.e., random walk). Dependency embedding is constructed by combining values for IP addresses from their embedding and used for training the resulting dependency classifier. We evaluated the approach using IP flow datasets from a controlled environment and university campus network that contain evidence about dependencies. Evaluation concerning the correctness and relationship to other approaches shows that the approach achieves acceptable performance. It can simultaneously consider all types of dependencies and is applicable for batch processing in operational conditions.",

However, MRI requires long acquisition times, with recent deep learning-based methods showing great promise to accelerate imaging and enhance reconstruction quality. Existing networks exhibit some common limitations that constrain further acceleration possibilities, including single-domain learning, reliance on a single regularization term, and equal feature contribution. To address these limitations, we propose to embed information from multiple domains, including low-rank, image, and k-space, in a novel deep learning network for MRI reconstruction, which we denote as A-LIKNet. A-LIKNet adopts a parallel-branch structure, enabling independent learning in the k-space and image domain. Coupled information sharing layers realize the information exchange between domains. Furthermore, we introduce attention mechanisms into the network to assign greater weights to more critical coils or important temporal frames. Training and testing were conducted on an in-house dataset, including 91 cardiovascular patients and 38 healthy subjects scanned with 2D cardiac Cine using retrospective undersampling. Additionally, we evaluated A-LIKNet on the real-time 8x prospectively undersampled data from the OCMR dataset. The results demonstrate that our proposed A-LIKNet outperforms existing methods and provides high-quality reconstructions. The network can effectively reconstruct highly retrospectively undersampled dynamic MR images up to 24x accelerations, indicating its potential for single breath-hold imaging.",

To enhance privacy, face template protection techniques are widely employed to conceal sensitive identity and appearance information stored in the template. This paper identifies an emerging privacy attack form utilizing diffusion models that could nullify prior protection, referred to as inversion attacks. The attack can synthesize high-quality, identity-preserving face images from templates, revealing persons' appearance. Based on studies of the diffusion model's generative capability, this paper proposes a defense to deteriorate the attack, by rotating templates to a noise-like distribution. This is achieved efficiently by spherically and linearly interpolating templates, or slerp, on their located hypersphere. This paper further proposes to group-wisely divide and drop out templates' feature dimensions, to enhance the irreversibility of rotated templates. The division of groups and dropouts within each group are learned in a recognition-favored way. The proposed techniques are concretized as a novel face template protection technique, SlerpFace. Extensive experiments show that SlerpFace provides satisfactory recognition accuracy and comprehensive privacy protection against inversion and other attack forms, superior to prior arts.",

The mathematical relationship between the transmission reliability and the perceptual quality of the regenerated image and the semantic values of semantic features are modeled, which are obtained by conducting numerical simulations on the Kodak dataset. We also investigate the semantic-aware power allocation problem, with the objective of minimizing the total power consumption while guaranteeing semantic performance. To solve this problem, two semanticaware power allocation methods are proposed by constraint decoupling and bisection search, respectively. Numerical results show that the proposed semantic-aware methods demonstrate superior performance compared to the conventional one in terms of total power consumption.",

To address this, we introduce Cactus, a multi-turn dialogue dataset that emulates real-life interactions using the goal-oriented and structured approach of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). We create a diverse and realistic dataset by designing clients with varied, specific personas, and having counselors systematically apply CBT techniques in their interactions.

Most backdoor attacks in FL assume a predefined target class and require control over a large number of clients or knowledge of benign clients' information. Furthermore, they are not imperceptible and are easily detected by human inspection due to clear artifacts left on the poison data. To overcome these challenges, we propose Venomancer, an effective backdoor attack that is imperceptible and allows target-on-demand. Specifically, imperceptibility is achieved by using a visual loss function to make the poison data visually indistinguishable from the original data. Target-on-demand property allows the attacker to choose arbitrary target classes via conditional adversarial training. Additionally, experiments showed that the method is robust against state-of-the-art defenses such as Norm Clipping, Weak DP, Krum, and Multi-Krum.

The unit-disk graph $G = (V, E)$ has vertex set $V$ and an edge $e_{uv} \\in E$ between vertices $u, v \\in V$ if the Euclidean distance between $u$ and $v$ is at most 1. The weight of each edge $e_{uv}$ is the Euclidean distance between $u$ and $v$. Given $V$ and a source point $s\\in V$, we consider the problem of computing shortest paths in $G$ from $s$ to all other vertices. The previously best algorithm for this problem runs in $O(n \\log^2 n)$ time [Wang and Xue, SoCG'19]. The problem has an $\u03a9(n\\log n)$ lower bound under the algebraic decision tree model. In this paper, we present an improved algorithm of $O(n \\log^2 n / \\log \\log n)$ time (under the standard real RAM model). Furthermore, we show that the problem can be solved using $O(n\\log n)$ comparisons under the algebraic decision tree model, matching the $\u03a9(n\\log n)$ lower bound.",

We propose a novel task of Colloquial Description-to-Song Generation, which focuses on aligning the generated content with colloquial human expressions. This task is aimed at bridging the gap between colloquial language understanding and auditory expression within an AI model, with the ultimate goal of creating songs that accurately satisfy human auditory expectations and structurally align with musical norms. Current datasets are limited due to their narrow descriptive scope, semantic gaps and inaccuracies. To overcome data scarcity in this domain, we present the Caichong Music Dataset (CaiMD). CaiMD is manually annotated by both professional musicians and amateurs, offering diverse perspectives and a comprehensive understanding of colloquial descriptions. Unlike existing datasets pre-set with expert annotations or auto-generated ones with inherent biases, CaiMD caters more sufficiently to our purpose of aligning AI-generated music with widespread user-desired results. Moreover, we propose an innovative single-stage framework called MuDiT/MuSiT for enabling effective human-machine alignment in song creation. This framework not only achieves cross-modal comprehension between colloquial language and auditory music perceptions but also ensures generated songs align with user-desired results. MuDiT/MuSiT employs one DiT/SiT model for end-to-end generation of musical components like melody, harmony, rhythm, vocals, and instrumentation. The approach ensures harmonious sonic cohesiveness amongst all generated musical components, facilitating better resonance with human auditory expectations.",

In this model, we are given an oracle that takes as its input a set of elements, and returns as its output the minimum of the ranks of the given set in the two matroids. For the unweighted matroid intersection problem, we show how to construct a necessary part of the exchangeability graph, which enables us to emulate the standard augmenting path algorithm. Furthermore, we reformulate Edmonds' min-max theorem only using the minimum rank function, providing a new perspective on this result. For the weighted problem, the tractability is open in general. Nevertheless, we describe several special cases where tractability can be achieved, and we discuss potential approaches and the challenges encountered. In particular, we present a solution for the case where no circuit of one matroid is contained within a circuit of the other. Additionally, we propose a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, parameterized by the maximum circuit size. We also show that a lexicographically maximal common independent set can be found by the same approach, which leads to at least $1/2$-approximation for finding a maximum-weight common independent set.",

This is a critical question at the heart of democratic representation and particularly relevant at times when political dissatisfaction and populism are on the rise. To answer this question we compare the online discourse of elected politicians and their constituents. We collect a two and a half years (September 2020 - February 2023) constituency-level dataset for USA and UK that includes: (i) the Twitter timelines (5.6 Million tweets) of elected political representatives (595 UK Members of Parliament and 433 USA Representatives), (ii) the Nextdoor posts (21.8 Million posts) of the constituency (98.4% USA and 91.5% UK constituencies). We find that elected politicians tend to be equally similar to their constituents in terms of content and style regardless of whether a constituency elects a right or left-wing politician. The size of the electoral victory and the level of income of a constituency shows a nuanced picture. The narrower the electoral victory, the more similar the style and the more dissimilar the content is. The lower the income of a constituency, the more similar the content is. In terms of style, poorer constituencies tend to have a more similar sentiment and more dissimilar psychological text traits (i.e. measured with LIWC categories).",

It provides interactive services for managing billing and electricity consumption, but it also introduces new vectors for cyberattacks. Although, the devastating and severe impact of power overloading cyberattacks on smart grid AMI, few researches in the literature have addressed them. In the present paper, we propose a two-level anomaly detection framework based on regression decision trees. The introduced detection approach leverages the regularity and predictability of energy consumption to build reference consumption patterns for the whole neighborhood and each household within it. Using a reference consumption pattern enables detecting power overloading cyberattacks regardless of the attacker's strategy as they cause a drastic change in the consumption pattern. The continuous two-level monitoring of energy consumption load allows efficient and early detection of cyberattacks. We carried out an extensive experiment on a real-world publicly available energy consumption dataset of 500 customers in Ireland. We extracted, from the raw data, the relevant attributes for training the energy consumption patterns. The evaluation shows that our approach achieves a high detection rate, a low false alarm rate, and superior performances compared to existing solutions.",

The framework analyzes images across three levels: the plastic level, encompassing fundamental visual features like lines and colors; the figurative level, representing specific entities or concepts; and the enunciation level, which focuses particularly on constructing the point of view of the spectator and observer. These levels are analyzed to discern deeper narrative layers within the imagery.

However, it is challenging to characterize and study progress in multimodal foundation models, given the range of possible modeling decisions, tasks, and domains. In this paper, we introduce Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal Models (HEMM) to systematically evaluate the capabilities of multimodal foundation models across a set of 3 dimensions: basic skills, information flow, and real-world use cases. Basic multimodal skills are internal abilities required to solve problems, such as learning interactions across modalities, fine-grained alignment, multi-step reasoning, and the ability to handle external knowledge. Information flow studies how multimodal content changes during a task through querying, translation, editing, and fusion. Use cases span domain-specific challenges introduced in real-world multimedia, affective computing, natural sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction applications. Through comprehensive experiments across the 30 tasks in HEMM, we (1) identify key dataset dimensions (e.g., basic skills, information flows, and use cases) that pose challenges to today's models, and (2) distill performance trends regarding how different modeling dimensions (e.g., scale, pre-training data, multimodal alignment, pre-training, and instruction tuning objectives) influence performance. Our conclusions regarding challenging multimodal interactions, use cases, and tasks requiring reasoning and external knowledge, the benefits of data and model scale, and the impacts of instruction tuning yield actionable insights for future work in multimodal foundation models.",

        "abstract": "A transfer function approach has recently proven effective for calibrating deep learning (DL) algorithms in quantitative ultrasound (QUS), addressing data shifts at both the acquisition and machine levels. Expanding on this approach, we develop a strategy to 'steal' the functionality of a DL model from one ultrasound machine and implement it on another, in the context of QUS. This demonstrates the ease with which the functionality of a DL model can be transferred between machines, highlighting the security risks associated with deploying such models in a commercial scanner for clinical use. The proposed method is a black-box unsupervised domain adaptation technique that integrates the transfer function approach with an iterative schema. It does not utilize any information related to model internals of the victim machine but it solely relies on the availability of input-output interface. Additionally, we assume the availability of unlabelled data from the testing machine, i.e., the perpetrator machine. This scenario could become commonplace as companies begin deploying their DL functionalities for clinical use. Competing companies might acquire the victim machine and, through the input-output interface, replicate the functionality onto their own machines. In the experiments, we used a SonixOne and a Verasonics machine. The victim model was trained on SonixOne data, and its functionality was then transferred to the Verasonics machine. The proposed method successfully transferred the functionality to the Verasonics machine, achieving a remarkable 98\\% classification accuracy in a binary decision task. This study underscores the need to establish security measures prior to deploying DL models in clinical settings.",

Additionally, Deep Learning (DL) methods face challenges: the opacity of 'black box' models and the need for performance enhancement. Our Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) based models (RS_UNet, LC_UNet, UUNet, and WD_UNet) address these challenges by combining diverse query strategies with various DL models. We train four HCI models and repeat these steps: (1) Query Strategy: The HCI models select samples that provide the most additional representative information when labeled in each iteration and identify unlabeled samples with the greatest predictive disparity using Wasserstein Distance, Least Confidence, Entropy Sampling, and Random Sampling. (2) Central line correction: Selected samples are used for expert correction of system-generated tracheal central lines in each training round. (3) Update training dataset: Experts update the training dataset after each DL model's training epoch, enhancing the trustworthiness and performance of the models. (4) Model training: The HCI model is trained using the updated dataset and an enhanced UNet version. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of these HCI-based approaches, showing that WD-UNet, LC-UNet, UUNet, and RS-UNet achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art DL models. Notably, WD-UNet achieves this with only 15%-35% of the training data, reducing physician annotation time by 65%-85%.",

While research has focused on pro-anorexia online communities that glorify the 'thin ideal', less attention has been given to the broader spectrum of body image concerns or how emerging disorders like muscle dysmorphia ('bigorexia') present in online discussions. To address these gaps, we analyze 46 Reddit discussion forums related to diet, fitness, and associated mental health challenges. Using membership structure analysis and transformer-based language models, we project these communities along gender and body ideal axes, revealing complex interactions between gender, body ideals, and emotional expression. Our findings show that feminine-oriented communities generally express more negative emotions, particularly in thinness-promoting forums. Conversely, communities focused on the muscular ideal exhibit less negativity, regardless of gender orientation. We also uncover a gendered pattern in emotional indicators of mental health challenges, with communities discussing serious issues aligning more closely with thinness-oriented, predominantly feminine-leaning communities. By revealing the gendered emotional dynamics of online communities, our findings can inform the development of more effective content moderation approaches that facilitate supportive interactions, while minimizing exposure to potentially harmful content.",

For robots operating in the real world, the safety-critical design often needs to explicitly address uncertainties and the pre-computed guarantees often rely on the assumption of the particular distribution of the uncertainty. However, it is difficult to characterize the actual uncertainty distribution beforehand and thus the established safety guarantee may be violated due to possible distribution mismatch. In this paper, we propose a novel safe control framework that provides a high-probability safety guarantee for stochastic dynamical systems following unknown distributions of motion noise. Specifically, this framework adopts adaptive conformal prediction to dynamically quantify the prediction uncertainty from online observations and combines that with the probabilistic extension of the control barrier functions (CBFs) to characterize the uncertainty-aware control constraints. By integrating the constraints in the model predictive control scheme, it allows robots to adaptively capture the true prediction uncertainty online in a distribution-free setting and enjoys formally provable high-probability safety assurance. Simulation results on multi-robot systems with stochastic single-integrator dynamics and unicycle dynamics are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

Persuasive chatbots can accelerate the positive effects of persuasion in such applications. Existing methods rely on fine-tuning persuasive chatbots with task-specific training data which is costly, if not infeasible, to collect. To address this issue, we propose a method to leverage the generalizability and inherent persuasive abilities of large language models (LLMs) in creating effective and truthful persuasive chatbot for any given domain in a zero-shot manner. Unlike previous studies which used pre-defined persuasion strategies, our method first uses an LLM to generate responses, then extracts the strategies used on the fly, and replaces any unsubstantiated claims in the response with retrieved facts supporting the strategies. We applied our chatbot, PersuaBot, to three significantly different domains needing persuasion skills: donation solicitation, recommendations, and health intervention. Our experiments on simulated and human conversations show that our zero-shot approach is more persuasive than prior work, while achieving factual accuracy surpassing state-of-the-art knowledge-oriented chatbots. Our study demonstrated that when persuasive chatbots are employed responsibly for social good, it is an enabler of positive individual and social change.",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for HSI denoising and destriping, called NLTL2p, which consists of an orthogonal constrained minimization model and an iterative algorithm with convergence guarantees. The model of the proposed NLTL2p approach is built based on a new sparsity-enhanced Nonlocal Low-rank Tensor regularization and a tensor $\\ell_{2,p}$ norm with $p\\in(0,1)$. The low-rank constraints for HSI denoising utilize the spatial nonlocal self-similarity and spectral correlation of HSIs and are formulated based on independent higher-order singular value decomposition with sparsity enhancement on its core tensor to prompt more low-rankness. The tensor $\\ell_{2,p}$ norm for HSI destriping is extended from the matrix $\\ell_{2,p}$ norm. A proximal block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed in the NLTL2p approach to solve the resulting nonconvex nonsmooth minimization with orthogonal constraints. We show any accumulation point of the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point, which is defined using three equalities of substationarity, symmetry, and feasibility for orthogonal constraints. In the numerical experiments, we compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods including a deep learning based method, and test the methods on both simulated and real HSI datasets. Our proposed NLTL2p method demonstrates outperformance in terms of metrics such as mean peak signal-to-noise ratio as well as visual quality.",

The pre-processed event logs were then fed to the Split Miner (SM) algorithm to produce a process model. Process model quality was evaluated before and after concatenation using the following metrics: fitness, precision, F-Measure, and complexity. The pre-processed event logs were also used as inputs to the Decay Replay Mining (DREAM) algorithm to predict critical outcomes. We compared predicted results before and after applying the concatenation algorithm using Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Confidence Intervals (CI). Results indicated that the concatenation algorithm improved the quality of the process models and predictions of the critical health outcomes.",

Therefore, interpreting these models may provide novel insights into the underlying biology, supporting downstream biomedical applications. Due to their complexity, interpretable surrogate models can only be built for local explanations (e.g., a single instance). However, accomplishing this requires generating a dataset in the neighborhood of the input, which must maintain syntactic similarity to the original data while introducing semantic variability in the model's predictions. This task is challenging due to the complex sequence-to-function relationship of DNA. We propose using Genetic Programming to generate datasets by evolving perturbations in sequences that contribute to their semantic diversity. Our custom, domain-guided individual representation effectively constrains syntactic similarity, and we provide two alternative fitness functions that promote diversity with no computational effort. Applied to the RNA splicing domain, our approach quickly achieves good diversity and significantly outperforms a random baseline in exploring the search space, as shown by our proof-of-concept, short RNA sequence. Furthermore, we assess its generalizability and demonstrate scalability to larger sequences, resulting in a ~30% improvement over the baseline.",

An additional challenge is the lack of access to protected user attributes such as gender, for which we propose a solution to obtain a proxy estimate. Despite being anonymized and including a proxy for a sensitive attribute, our dataset preserves predictive power and maintains a realistic and challenging benchmark. This dataset addresses a significant gap in the availability of fairness-focused resources for high-impact domains like advertising -- the actual impact being having access or not to precious employment opportunities, where balancing fairness and utility is a common industrial challenge. We also explore various stages in the advertising process where unfairness can occur and introduce a method to compute a fair utility metric for the job recommendations in online systems case from a biased dataset. Experimental evaluations of bias mitigation techniques on the released dataset demonstrate potential improvements in fairness and the associated trade-offs with utility.",

One of these areas is ML-based near-real-time network management applications (xApps) in Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN). Normally, xApps are designed solely for the desired objectives, and fine-tuned for deployment. However, telecommunication companies can employ multiple xApps and deploy them in overlapping areas. Consider the different design objectives of xApps, the deployment might cause conflicts. To prevent such conflicts, we proposed the xApp distillation method that distills knowledge from multiple xApps, then uses this knowledge to train a single model that has retained the capabilities of Previous xApps. Performance evaluations show that compared conflict mitigation schemes can cause up to six times more network outages than xApp distillation in some cases.",

        "abstract": "Protein sequence design, determined by amino acid sequences, are essential to protein engineering problems in drug discovery. Prior approaches have resorted to evolutionary strategies or Monte-Carlo methods for protein design, but often fail to exploit the structure of the combinatorial search space, to generalize to unseen sequences. In the context of discrete black box optimization over large search spaces, learning a mutation policy to generate novel sequences with reinforcement learning is appealing. Recent advances in protein language models (PLMs) trained on large corpora of protein sequences offer a potential solution to this problem by scoring proteins according to their biological plausibility (such as the TM-score). In this work, we propose to use PLMs as a reward function to generate new sequences. Yet the PLM can be computationally expensive to query due to its large size. To this end, we propose an alternative paradigm where optimization can be performed on scores from a smaller proxy model that is periodically finetuned, jointly while learning the mutation policy. We perform extensive experiments on various sequence lengths to benchmark RL-based approaches, and provide comprehensive evaluations along biological plausibility and diversity of the protein. Our experimental results include favorable evaluations of the proposed sequences, along with high diversity scores, demonstrating that RL is a strong candidate for biological sequence design. Finally, we provide a modular open source implementation can be easily integrated in most RL training loops, with support for replacing the reward model with other PLMs, to spur further research in this domain.

We find that minor modifications, such as adjustments to the learning objectives and the integration of deep learning architectures, significantly enhance NCA's performance, enabling it to surpass most modern deep tabular models. Additionally, we introduce a stochastic neighbor sampling strategy that improves both the efficiency and predictive accuracy of our proposed ModernNCA -- sampling only a subset of neighbors during training, while utilizing the entire neighborhood during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ModernNCA achieves state-of-the-art results in both classification and regression tasks across various tabular datasets, outperforming both tree-based and other deep tabular models, while also reducing training time and model size.",

In this work, we explore the inductive bias and expressivity of quantum neural networks (QNNs), which gives us a way to compare their performance to those of DNNs. Our results show that it is possible to have simplicity bias with certain QNNs, but we prove that this type of QNN limits the expressivity of the QNN. We also show that it is possible to have QNNs with high expressivity, but they either have no inductive bias or a poor inductive bias and result in a worse generalisation performance compared to DNNs. We demonstrate that an artificial (restricted) inductive bias can be produced by intentionally restricting the expressivity of a QNN. Our results suggest a bias-expressivity tradeoff. Our conclusion is that the QNNs we studied can not generally offer an advantage over DNNs, because these QNNs either have a poor inductive bias or poor expressivity compared to DNNs.",

Local differential privacy (LDP) and distributed DP with secure aggregation (SecAgg) are the most common notions of DP used in DP-DME settings with an untrusted server. LDP provides strong resilience to dropouts, colluding users, and malicious server attacks, but suffers from poor utility. In contrast, SecAgg-based DP-DME achieves an $O(n)$ utility gain over LDP in DME, but requires increased communication and computation overheads and complex multi-round protocols to handle dropouts and malicious attacks. In this work, we propose CorDP-DME, a novel DP-DME mechanism that spans the gap between DME with LDP and distributed DP, offering a favorable balance between utility and resilience to dropout and collusion. CorDP-DME is based on correlated Gaussian noise, ensuring DP without the perfect conditional privacy guarantees of SecAgg-based approaches. We provide an information-theoretic analysis of CorDP-DME, and derive theoretical guarantees for utility under any given privacy parameters and dropout/colluding user thresholds. Our results demonstrate that (anti) correlated Gaussian DP mechanisms can significantly improve utility in mean estimation tasks compared to LDP -- even in adversarial settings -- while maintaining better resilience to dropouts and attacks compared to distributed DP.",

Many psychological studies have observed that personalities are strongly reflected in their social behaviors and social environments. In light of these problems, this paper proposes a sociological analysis framework for one's personality in an environment-based view instead of individual-level data mining. Specifically, to comprehensively understand an individual's behavior from low-quality records, we leverage the powerful associative ability of LLMs by designing an effective prompt. In this way, LLMs can integrate various scattered information with their external knowledge to generate higher-quality profiles, which can significantly improve the personality analysis performance. To explore the interactive mechanism behind the users and their online environments, we design an effective hypergraph neural network where the hypergraph nodes are users and the hyperedges in the hypergraph are social environments. We offer a useful dataset with user profile data, personality traits, and several detected environments from the real-world social platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first network-based dataset containing both hypergraph structure and social information, which could push forward future research in this area further. By employing the framework on this dataset, we can effectively capture the nuances of individual personalities and their online behaviors, leading to a deeper understanding of human interactions in the digital world.",

        "abstract": "In real-time status update services for the Internet of Things (IoT), the timely dissemination of information requiring timely updates is crucial to maintaining its relevance. Failing to keep up with these updates results in outdated information. The age of information (AoI) serves as a metric to quantify the freshness of information. The Existing works to optimize AoI primarily focus on the transmission time from the information source to the monitor, neglecting the transmission time from the monitor to the destination. This oversight significantly impacts information freshness and subsequently affects decision-making accuracy. To address this gap, we designed an edge-enabled vehicular fog system to lighten the computational burden on IoT devices. We examined how information transmission and request-response times influence end-to-end AoI. As a solution, we proposed Dueling-Deep Queue Network (dueling-DQN), a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm and compared its performance with DQN policy and analytical results. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dueling-DQN algorithm outperforms both DQN and analytical methods, highlighting its effectiveness in improving real-time system information freshness. Considering the complete end-to-end transmission process, our optimization approach can improve decision-making performance and overall system efficiency.",

MalGuise first employs a novel semantics-preserving transformation of call-based redividing to concurrently manipulate both nodes and edges of malware's control-flow graph, making it less noticeable. By employing a Monte-Carlo-tree-search-based optimization, MalGuise then searches for an optimized sequence of call-based redividing transformations to apply to the input Windows malware for evasions. Finally, it reconstructs the adversarial malware file based on the optimized transformation sequence while adhering to Windows executable format constraints, thereby maintaining the same semantics as the original. MalGuise is systematically evaluated against three state-of-the-art learning-based Windows malware detection systems under the black-box setting. Evaluation results demonstrate that MalGuise achieves a remarkably high attack success rate, mostly exceeding 95%, with over 91% of the generated adversarial malware files maintaining the same semantics. Furthermore, MalGuise achieves up to a 74.97% attack success rate against five anti-virus products, highlighting potential tangible security concerns to real-world users.",

For more reasonable synthesis error, we then show a similar relationships for BQP and QCMA.

To address this issue, we leverage intermediate sequences to estimate the common latent space among multi-sequence MRI, enabling the reconstruction of distinct sequences from the common latent space. We propose a generative model that compresses discrete representations of each sequence to estimate the Gaussian distribution of vector-quantized common (VQC) latent space between multiple sequences. Moreover, we improve the latent space consistency with contrastive learning and increase model stability by domain augmentation. Experiments using BraTS2021 dataset show that our non-adversarial model outperforms other GAN-based methods, and VQC latent space aids our model to achieve (1) anti-interference ability, which can eliminate the effects of noise, bias fields, and artifacts, and (2) solid semantic representation ability, with the potential of one-shot segmentation.

        "abstract": "Real-time 3D reconstruction of surgical scenes plays a vital role in computer-assisted surgery, holding a promise to enhance surgeons' visibility. Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown great potential for real-time novel view synthesis of general scenes, which relies on accurate poses and point clouds generated by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for initialization. However, 3DGS with SfM fails to recover accurate camera poses and geometry in surgical scenes due to the challenges of minimal textures and photometric inconsistencies. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose the first SfM-free 3DGS-based method for surgical scene reconstruction by jointly optimizing the camera poses and scene representation. Based on the video continuity, the key of our method is to exploit the immediate optical flow priors to guide the projection flow derived from 3D Gaussians. Unlike most previous methods relying on photometric loss only, we formulate the pose estimation problem as minimizing the flow loss between the projection flow and optical flow. A consistency check is further introduced to filter the flow outliers by detecting the rigid and reliable points that satisfy the epipolar geometry. During 3D Gaussian optimization, we randomly sample frames to optimize the scene representations to grow the 3D Gaussian progressively. Experiments on the SCARED dataset demonstrate our superior performance over existing methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation with high efficiency.

        "abstract": "Wireless networks consisting of low SWaP, FW-UAVs are used in many applications, such as monitoring, search and surveillance of inaccessible areas. A decentralized and autonomous approach ensures robustness to failures; the UAVs explore and sense within the area and forward their information, in a multihop manner, to nearby aerial gateway nodes. However, the unpredictable nature of the events, relatively high speed of UAVs, and dynamic UAV trajectories cause the network topology to change significantly over time, resulting in frequent route breaks. A holistic routing approach is needed to support multiple traffic flows in these networks to provide mobility- and congestion-aware, high-quality routes when needed, with low control and computational overheads, using the information collected in a distributed manner. Existing routing schemes do not address all the mentioned issues. We present a hybrid reactive routing protocol for decentralized UAV networks. Our scheme searches routes on-demand, monitors a region around the selected route (the pipe), and proactively switches to an alternative route before the current route's quality degrades below a threshold. We empirically evaluate the impact of pipe width and node density on our ability to find alternate high-quality routes within the pipe and the overhead required to maintain the pipe. Compared to existing reactive routing schemes, our approach achieves higher throughput and reduces the number of route discoveries, overhead, and resulting flow interruptions at different traffic loads, node densities and speeds. Despite having limited network topology information, and low overhead and route computation complexity, our proposed scheme achieves superior throughput to proactive optimized link state routing scheme at different network and traffic settings. We also evaluate the relative performance of reactive and proactive routing schemes.",

However, due to the large computational complexity, efficient hardware implementation of NNs is challenging. Especially the backpropagation algorithm, required to adapt the NN's parameters to varying channel conditions, is highly complex, limiting the throughput on resource-constrained devices like field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In this work, we present an FPGA architecture of an NN-based equalizer that exploits batch-level parallelism of the convolutional layer to enable a custom mapping scheme of two multiplication to a single digital signal processor (DSP). Our implementation achieves a throughput of up to 20 GBd, which enables the equalization of high-data-rate nonlinear optical fiber channels while providing adaptation capabilities by retraining the NN using backpropagation. As a result, our FPGA implementation outperforms an embedded graphics processing unit (GPU) in terms of throughput by two orders of magnitude. Further, we achieve a higher energy efficiency and throughput as state-of-the-art NN training FPGA implementations.

GeCAs are evaluated as an effective augmentation tool for retinal disease classification across two imaging modalities: Fundus and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). In the context of OCT imaging, where data is scarce and the distribution of classes is inherently skewed, GeCA significantly boosts the performance of 11 different ophthalmological conditions, achieving a 12% increase in the average F1 score compared to conventional baselines. GeCAs outperform both diffusion methods that incorporate UNet or state-of-the art variants with transformer-based denoising models, under similar parameter constraints.

        "abstract": "In the realm of practical Anomaly Detection (AD) tasks, manual labeling of anomalous pixels proves to be a costly endeavor. Consequently, many AD methods are crafted as one-class classifiers, tailored for training sets completely devoid of anomalies, ensuring a more cost-effective approach. While some pioneering work has demonstrated heightened AD accuracy by incorporating real anomaly samples in training, this enhancement comes at the price of labor-intensive labeling processes. This paper strikes the balance between AD accuracy and labeling expenses by introducing ADClick, a novel Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm. ADClick efficiently generates \"ground-truth\" anomaly masks for real defective images, leveraging innovative residual features and meticulously crafted language prompts. Notably, ADClick showcases a significantly elevated generalization capacity compared to existing state-of-the-art IIS approaches. Functioning as an anomaly labeling tool, ADClick generates high-quality anomaly labels (AP $= 94.1\\%$ on MVTec AD) based on only $3$ to $5$ manual click annotations per training image. Furthermore, we extend the capabilities of ADClick into ADClick-Seg, an enhanced model designed for anomaly detection and localization. By fine-tuning the ADClick-Seg model using the weak labels inferred by ADClick, we establish the state-of-the-art performances in supervised AD tasks (AP $= 86.4\\%$ on MVTec AD and AP $= 78.4\\%$, PRO $= 98.6\\%$ on KSDD2).",

        "abstract": "A key requirement in robotics is the ability to simultaneously self-localize and map a previously unknown environment, relying primarily on onboard sensing and computation. Achieving fully onboard accurate simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is feasible for high-end robotic platforms, whereas small and inexpensive robots face challenges due to constrained hardware, therefore frequently resorting to external infrastructure for sensing and computation. The challenge is further exacerbated in swarms of robots, where coordination, scalability, and latency are crucial concerns. This work introduces a decentralized and lightweight collaborative SLAM approach that enables mapping on virtually any robot, even those equipped with low-cost hardware, including miniaturized insect-size devices. Moreover, the proposed solution supports large swarm formations with the capability to coordinate hundreds of agents. To substantiate our claims, we have successfully implemented collaborative SLAM on centimeter-size drones weighing only 46 grams. Remarkably, we achieve results comparable to high-end state-of-the-art solutions while reducing the cost, memory, and computation requirements by two orders of magnitude. Our approach is innovative in three main aspects. First, it enables onboard infrastructure-less collaborative mapping with a lightweight and cost-effective solution in terms of sensing and computation. Second, we optimize the data traffic within the swarm to support hundreds of cooperative agents using standard wireless protocols such as ultra-wideband (UWB), Bluetooth, or WiFi. Last, we implement a distributed swarm coordination policy to decrease mapping latency and enhance accuracy.",

Instead of following mainstream diffusion-based methods, we explore and extend the potential of the implicit-keypoint-based framework, which effectively balances computational efficiency and controllability. Building upon this, we develop a video-driven portrait animation framework named LivePortrait with a focus on better generalization, controllability, and efficiency for practical usage. To enhance the generation quality and generalization ability, we scale up the training data to about 69 million high-quality frames, adopt a mixed image-video training strategy, upgrade the network architecture, and design better motion transformation and optimization objectives. Additionally, we discover that compact implicit keypoints can effectively represent a kind of blendshapes and meticulously propose a stitching and two retargeting modules, which utilize a small MLP with negligible computational overhead, to enhance the controllability. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework even compared to diffusion-based methods. The generation speed remarkably reaches 12.8ms on an RTX 4090 GPU with PyTorch.

In this paper, we propose an Efficient Dual Prototype Network (EDPNet) to enable accurate and fast MI decoding. EDPNet employs a lightweight adaptive spatial-spectral fusion module, which promotes more efficient information fusion between multiple EEG electrodes. Subsequently, a parameter-free multi-scale variance pooling module extracts more comprehensive temporal features. Furthermore, we introduce dual prototypical learning to optimize the feature space distribution and training process, thereby improving the model's generalization ability on small-sample MI datasets. Our experimental results show that the EDPNet outperforms state-of-the-art models with superior classification accuracy and kappa values (84.11% and 0.7881 for dataset BCI competition IV 2a, 86.65% and 0.7330 for dataset BCI competition IV 2b). Additionally, we use the BCI competition III IVa dataset with fewer training data to further validate the generalization ability of the proposed EDPNet. We also achieve superior performance with 82.03% classification accuracy. Benefiting from the lightweight parameters and superior decoding accuracy, our EDPNet shows great potential for MI-BCI applications.

In this work, we focus on investigating the expressiveness of human avatars when learned from monocular RGB video; a setting that introduces new challenges in capturing and animating fine-grained details. To this end, we introduce EVA, a drivable human model that meticulously sculpts fine details based on 3D Gaussians and SMPL-X, an expressive parametric human model. Focused on enhancing expressiveness, our work makes three key contributions. First, we highlight the critical importance of aligning the SMPL-X model with RGB frames for effective avatar learning. Recognizing the limitations of current SMPL-X prediction methods for in-the-wild videos, we introduce a plug-and-play module that significantly ameliorates misalignment issues. Second, we propose a context-aware adaptive density control strategy, which is adaptively adjusting the gradient thresholds to accommodate the varied granularity across body parts. Last but not least, we develop a feedback mechanism that predicts per-pixel confidence to better guide the learning of 3D Gaussians. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially on the fine-grained hand and facial details.

        "abstract": "Background: Deep learning models have shown promise in diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) like ASD and ADHD. However, many models either use graph neural networks (GNN) to construct single-level brain functional networks (BFNs) or employ spatial convolution filtering for local information extraction from rs-fMRI data, often neglecting high-order features crucial for NDD classification. Methods: We introduce a Multi-view High-order Network (MHNet) to capture hierarchical and high-order features from multi-view BFNs derived from rs-fMRI data for NDD prediction. MHNet has two branches: the Euclidean Space Features Extraction (ESFE) module and the Non-Euclidean Space Features Extraction (Non-ESFE) module, followed by a Feature Fusion-based Classification (FFC) module for NDD identification. ESFE includes a Functional Connectivity Generation (FCG) module and a High-order Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN) module to extract local and high-order features from BFNs in Euclidean space. Non-ESFE comprises a Generic Internet-like Brain Hierarchical Network Generation (G-IBHN-G) module and a High-order Graph Neural Network (HGNN) module to capture topological and high-order features in non-Euclidean space. Results: Experiments on three public datasets show that MHNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods using both AAL1 and Brainnetome Atlas templates. Extensive ablation studies confirm the superiority of MHNet and the effectiveness of using multi-view fMRI information and high-order features. Our study also offers atlas options for constructing more sophisticated hierarchical networks and explains the association between key brain regions and NDD. Conclusion: MHNet leverages multi-view feature learning from both Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces, incorporating high-order information from BFNs to enhance NDD classification performance.",

Leveraging a two-dimensional hexagonal waveguide mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers, these systems have demonstrated significant potential in microwave photonics applications. Additionally, they are a promising platform for creating unitary linear transformations, which are key elements in quantum computing and photonic neural networks. However, a general procedure for implementing these transformations on such systems has not been established yet. This work demonstrates the programming of universal unitary transformations on a general-purpose programmable photonic circuit with a hexagonal topology. We detail the steps to split the light on-chip, demonstrate that an equivalent structure to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer with one internal and one external phase shifter can be built in the hexagonal mesh, and program both the triangular and rectangular architectures for matrix multiplication. We recalibrate the system to account for passive phase deviations. Experimental programming of 3x3 and 4x4 random unitary matrices yields fidelities > 98% and bit precisions over 5 bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that random unitary matrices are demonstrated on a general-purpose photonic processor and pave the way for the implementation of programmable photonic circuits in optical computing and signal processing systems.",

Having observed that the efficacy of the temporal fusion strategy in recent multi-view perception methods may be weakened by distractors and background clutters in historical frames, we propose a cyclic learning mechanism to improve the robustness of multi-view representation learning. The essence is constructing a backward bridge to propagate information from model predictions (e.g., object locations and sizes) to image and BEV features, which forms a circle with regular inference. After backward refinement, the responses of target-irrelevant regions in historical frames would be suppressed, decreasing the risk of polluting future frames and improving the object awareness ability of temporal fusion. We further tailor an object-aware association strategy for tracking based on the cyclic learning model. The cyclic learning model not only provides refined features, but also delivers finer clues (e.g., scale level) for tracklet association. The proposed cycle learning method and association module together contribute a novel and unified multi-task framework. Experiments on nuScenes show that the proposed model achieves consistent performance gains over baselines of different designs (i.e., dense query-based BEVFormer, sparse query-based SparseBEV and LSS-based BEVDet4D) on both detection and tracking evaluation.",

This study developed a deep learning model to classify systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean (MBP) BP changes using photoplethysmography (PPG) waveforms. Data from the Vital Signs Database (VitalDB) comprising 1,005 ICU patients with synchronized PPG and BP recordings was used. BP changes were categorized into three labels: Spike (increase above a threshold), Stable (change within a plus or minus threshold), and Dip (decrease below a threshold). Four time-series classification models were studied: multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network, residual network, and Encoder. A subset of 500 patients was randomly selected for training and validation, ensuring a uniform distribution across BP change labels. Two test datasets were compiled: Test-I (n=500) with a uniform distribution selection process, and Test-II (n=5) without. The study also explored the impact of including second-deviation PPG (sdPPG) waveforms as additional input information. The Encoder model with a Softmax weighting process using both PPG and sdPPG waveforms achieved the highest detection accuracy--exceeding 71.3% and 85.4% in Test-I and Test-II, respectively, with thresholds of 30 mmHg for SBP, 15 mmHg for DBP, and 20 mmHg for MBP. Corresponding F1-scores were over 71.8% and 88.5%.

        "abstract": "In digital pathology, the traditional method for deep learning-based image segmentation typically involves a two-stage process: initially segmenting high-resolution whole slide images (WSI) into smaller patches (e.g., 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024) and subsequently reconstructing them to their original scale. This method often struggles to capture the complex details and vast scope of WSIs. In this paper, we propose the holistic histopathology (HoloHisto) segmentation method to achieve end-to-end segmentation on gigapixel WSIs, whose maximum resolution is above 80,000$\\times$70,000 pixels. HoloHisto fundamentally shifts the paradigm of WSI segmentation to an end-to-end learning fashion with 1) a large (4K) resolution base patch for elevated visual information inclusion and efficient processing, and 2) a novel sequential tokenization mechanism to properly model the contextual relationships and efficiently model the rich information from the 4K input. To our best knowledge, HoloHisto presents the first holistic approach for gigapixel resolution WSI segmentation, supporting direct I/O of complete WSI and their corresponding gigapixel masks. Under the HoloHisto platform, we unveil a random 4K sampler that transcends ultra-high resolution, delivering 31 and 10 times more pixels than standard 2D and 3D patches, respectively, for advancing computational capabilities. To facilitate efficient 4K resolution dense prediction, we leverage sequential tokenization, utilizing a pre-trained image tokenizer to group image features into a discrete token grid. To assess the performance, our team curated a new kidney pathology image segmentation (KPIs) dataset with WSI-level glomeruli segmentation from whole mouse kidneys. From the results, HoloHisto-4K delivers remarkable performance gains over previous state-of-the-art models.",

To achieve these ambitious goals, it is apparent that 6G networks need to incorporate the state-of-the-art technologies. One of the technologies that has garnered rising interest is fluid antenna system (FAS) which represents any software-controllable fluidic, conductive, or dielectric structure capable of dynamically changing its shape and position to reconfigure essential radio-frequency (RF) characteristics. Compared to traditional antenna systems (TASs) with fixed-position radiating elements, the core idea of FAS revolves around the unique flexibility of reconfiguring the radiating elements within a given space. One recent driver of FAS is the recognition of its position-flexibility as a new degree of freedom (dof) to harness diversity and multiplexing gains. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive tutorial, covering channel modeling, signal processing and estimation methods, information-theoretic insights, new multiple access techniques, and hardware designs. Moreover, we delineate the challenges of FAS and explore the potential of using FAS to improve the performance of other contemporary technologies. By providing insights and guidance, this tutorial paper serves to inspire researchers to explore new horizons and fully unleash the potential of FAS.",

However, concerns about data misuse and leakage may deter individuals from donating their information. While prior research has indicated that Privacy Enhancement Technologies (PETs) can alleviate these concerns, the extent to which these techniques influence willingness to donate data remains unclear. This study conducts a vignette survey (N=485) to examine people's willingness to donate medical data for developing new treatments under four privacy guarantees: data expiration, anonymization, use restriction, and access control. The study explores two mechanisms for verifying these guarantees: self-auditing and expert auditing, and evaluates the impact on two types of data recipient entities: for-profit and non-profit institutions. Our findings reveal that the type of entity collecting data strongly influences respondents' privacy expectations, which in part influence their willingness to donate data. Respondents have such high expectations of the privacy provided by non-profit entities that explicitly stating the privacy protections provided makes little adjustment to those expectations. In contrast, statements about privacy bring respondents' expectations of the privacy provided by for-profit entities nearly in-line with non-profit expectations. We highlight the risks of these respective results as well as the need for future research to better align technical community and end-user perceptions about the effectiveness of auditing PETs and to effectively set expectations about the efficacy of PETs in the face of end-user concerns about data breaches.",

        "abstract": "Social computing scholars have long known that people do not interact with knowledge in straightforward ways, especially in digital environments. While policies around knowledge are essential for targeting misinformation, they are value-laden; in choosing how to present information, we undermine non-traditional -- often non-Western -- ways of knowing. Epistemic injustice is the systemic exclusion of certain people and methods from the knowledge canon. Epistemic injustice chips away at one's testimony and vocabulary until they are stripped of their due right to know and understand. In this paper, we articulate how epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications leads to material harm. Inspired by a hybrid collaborative autoethnography of 14 CSCW practitioners, we present three cases of epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications: online transgender healthcare, identity sensemaking on r/bisexual, and Indigenous ways of knowing on r/AskHistorians. We further explore signature tensions across our autoethnographic materials and relate them to previous CSCW research areas and personal non-technological experiences. We argue that epistemic injustice can serve as a unifying and intersectional lens for CSCW research by surfacing dimensions of epistemic community and power. Finally, we present a call to action of three changes the CSCW community should make to move toward its own goals of research justice. We call for CSCW researchers to center individual experiences, bolster communities, and remediate issues of epistemic power as a means towards epistemic justice. In sum, we recount, synthesize, and propose solutions for the various forms of epistemic injustice that CSCW sites of study -- including CSCW itself -- propagate.",

To address this gap, we have created the 'Celeb-FBI' dataset which contains 7,211 full-body images of individuals accompanied by detailed information on their height, age, weight, and gender. Following the dataset creation, we proceed with the preprocessing stages, including image cleaning, scaling, and the application of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Subsequently, utilizing this prepared dataset, we employed three deep learning approaches: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), 50-layer ResNet, and 16-layer VGG, which are used for estimating height, weight, age, and gender from human full-body images. From the results obtained, ResNet-50 performed best for the system with an accuracy rate of 79.18% for age, 95.43% for gender, 85.60% for height and 81.91% for weight.",

As short forward error correcting codes can help limiting latency, and code unification in 6G calls for flexible, possibly code-agnostic decoders, GRAND and ORBGRAND are well suited to tackle 6G URLLC. This work proposes a ultra-high, constant speed ORBGRAND decoder architecture with very low worst-case and average latency. Compared to a baseline architecture, through out-of-order output, aggressive clock gating, and selective programmability, the decoder reduces area, power, and average latency by 15.5%, 19.4%, and 56%, respectively.

In this domain, multimodal biometrics, which combines multiple biometric traits, has overcome limitations found in unimodal systems like susceptibility to spoof attacks or failure to adapt to changes over time. This paper proposes a novel multimodal biometric recognition system that utilizes deep learning algorithms using iris and palmprint modalities. A pioneering approach is introduced, beginning with the implementation of the novel Modified Firefly Algorithm with L\u00e9vy Flights (MFALF) to optimize the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) algorithm, thereby effectively enhancing image contrast. Subsequently, feature selection is carried out through a unique hybrid of ReliefF and Moth Flame Optimization (MFOR) to extract informative features. For classification, we employ a parallel approach, first introducing a novel Preactivated Inverted ResNet (PIR) architecture, and secondly, harnessing metaheuristics with hybrid of innovative Johnson Flower Pollination Algorithm and Rainfall Optimization Algorithm for fine tuning of the learning rate and dropout parameters of Transfer Learning based DenseNet architecture (JFPA-ROA). Finally, a score-level fusion strategy is implemented to combine the outputs of the two classifiers, providing a robust and accurate multimodal biometric recognition system. The system's performance is assessed based on accuracy, Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) Curve, Equal Error Rate (EER), and Total Training time. The proposed multimodal recognition architecture, tested across CASIA Palmprint, MMU, BMPD, and IIT datasets, achieves 100% recognition accuracy, outperforming unimodal iris and palmprint identification approaches.",

Our main contribution is to propose an $SE(3)$-equivariant model that maps each point in the cloud to a continuous grasp quality function over the 2-sphere $S^2$ using a spherical harmonic basis. Compared with reasoning about a finite set of samples, this formulation improves the accuracy and efficiency of our model when a large number of samples would otherwise be needed. In order to accomplish this, we propose a novel variation on EquiFormerV2 that leverages a UNet-style backbone to enlarge the number of points the model can handle.

        "abstract": "Medical image segmentation has been significantly advanced with the rapid development of deep learning (DL) techniques. Existing DL-based segmentation models are typically discriminative; i.e., they aim to learn a mapping from the input image to segmentation masks. However, these discriminative methods neglect the underlying data distribution and intrinsic class characteristics, suffering from unstable feature space. In this work, we propose to complement discriminative segmentation methods with the knowledge of underlying data distribution from generative models. To that end, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion framework for medical image segmentation, termed HiDiff, which can synergize the strengths of existing discriminative segmentation models and new generative diffusion models. HiDiff comprises two key components: discriminative segmentor and diffusion refiner. First, we utilize any conventional trained segmentation models as discriminative segmentor, which can provide a segmentation mask prior for diffusion refiner. Second, we propose a novel binary Bernoulli diffusion model (BBDM) as the diffusion refiner, which can effectively, efficiently, and interactively refine the segmentation mask by modeling the underlying data distribution. Third, we train the segmentor and BBDM in an alternate-collaborative manner to mutually boost each other. Extensive experimental results on abdomen organ, brain tumor, polyps, and retinal vessels segmentation datasets, covering four widely-used modalities, demonstrate the superior performance of HiDiff over existing medical segmentation algorithms, including the state-of-the-art transformer- and diffusion-based ones. In addition, HiDiff excels at segmenting small objects and generalizing to new datasets. Source codes are made available at https://github.com/takimailto/HiDiff.",

        "abstract": "Optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously is an important task in recommendation platforms to improve their performance on different fronts. However, this task is particularly challenging since the relationships between different objectives are heterogeneous across different consumers and dynamically fluctuating according to different contexts. Especially in those cases when objectives become conflicting with each other, the result of recommendations will form a pareto-frontier, where the improvements on any objective comes at the cost of a performance decrease in another objective. Unfortunately, existing multi-objective recommender systems do not systematically consider such relationships; instead, they balance between these objectives in a static and uniform manner, resulting in performance that is significantly worse than the pareto-optimality. In this paper, we propose a Deep Pareto Reinforcement Learning (DeepPRL) approach, where we (1) comprehensively model the complex relationships between multiple objectives in recommendations; (2) effectively capture the personalized and contextual consumer preference towards each objective and update the recommendations correspondingly; (3) optimize both the short-term and the long-term performance of multi-objective recommendations. As a result, our method achieves significant pareto-dominance over state-of-the-art baselines in extensive offline experiments conducted on three real-world datasets. Furthermore, we conduct a large-scale online controlled experiment at the video streaming platform of Alibaba, where our method simultaneously improves the three conflicting objectives of Click-Through Rate, Video View, and Dwell Time by 2%, 5%, and 7% respectively over the latest production system, demonstrating its tangible economic impact in industrial applications.",

To tackle this problem, we decompose the original problem into two sub-problems and use the alternating optimization to solve them iteratively. Using techniques of fractional programming and generalized Rayleigh quotient, the closed-form solution for each sub-problem is returned.

In this work, we delve into the potential of utilizing pre-trained stable diffusion for image restoration and propose MRIR, a diffusion-based restoration method with multimodal insights. Specifically, we explore the problem from two perspectives: textual level and visual level. For the textual level, we harness the power of the pre-trained multimodal large language model to infer meaningful semantic information from low-quality images. Furthermore, we employ the CLIP image encoder with a designed Refine Layer to capture image details as a supplement. For the visual level, we mainly focus on the pixel level control. Thus, we utilize a Pixel-level Processor and ControlNet to control spatial structures. Finally, we integrate the aforementioned control information into the denoising U-Net using multi-level attention mechanisms and realize controllable image restoration with multimodal insights. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate our method's superiority over other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",

We explore existing MIA techniques on time-series models, and introduce new features, focusing on the seasonality and trend components of the data. Seasonality is estimated using a multivariate Fourier transform, and a low-degree polynomial is used to approximate trends.

        "abstract": "Information regarding vaccines from sources such as health services, media, and social networks can significantly shape vaccination decisions. In particular, the dissemination of negative information can contribute to vaccine hesitancy, thereby exacerbating infectious disease outbreaks. This study investigates strategies to mitigate anti-vaccine social contagion through effective counter-campaigns that disseminate positive vaccine information and encourage vaccine uptake, aiming to reduce the size of epidemics. In a coupled agent-based model that consists of opinion and disease diffusion processes, we explore and compare different heuristics to design positive campaigns based on the network structure and local presence of negative vaccine attitudes. We examine two campaigning regimes: a static regime with a fixed set of targets, and a dynamic regime in which targets can be updated over time. We demonstrate that strategic targeting and engagement with the dynamics of anti-vaccine influence diffusion in the network can effectively mitigate the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment, thereby reducing the epidemic size. However, the effectiveness of the campaigns differs across different targeting strategies and is impacted by a range of factors. We find that the primary advantage of static campaigns lies in their capacity to act as an obstacle, preventing the clustering of emerging anti-vaccine communities, thereby resulting in smaller and unconnected anti-vaccine groups. On the other hand, dynamic campaigns reach a broader segment of the population and adapt to the evolution of anti-vaccine diffusion, not only protecting susceptible agents from negative influence but also fostering positive propagation within negative regions.",

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.",

The spatial domain of EEG is rich in affective information. However, few of the existing studies have simultaneously analyzed EEG signals from multiple perspectives of geometric and anatomical structures in spatial domain. In this paper, we propose a multi-view Graph Transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations, which integrates information from the temporal, frequency and spatial domains, including geometric and anatomical structures, so as to enhance the expressive power of the model comprehensively. We incorporate the spatial information of EEG channels into the model as encoding, thereby improving its ability to perceive the spatial structure of the channels. Meanwhile, experimental results based on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recent years.

        "abstract": "Honeypot technologies provide an effective defense strategy for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), particularly in enhancing the Advanced Metering Infrastructure's (AMI) security by bolstering the network intrusion detection system. For this security paradigm to be fully realized, it necessitates the active participation of small-scale power suppliers (SPSs) in implementing honeypots and engaging in collaborative data sharing with traditional power retailers (TPRs). To motivate this interaction, TPRs incentivize data sharing with tangible rewards. However, without access to an SPS's confidential data, it is daunting for TPRs to validate shared data, thereby risking SPSs' privacy and increasing sharing costs due to voluminous honeypot logs. These challenges can be resolved by utilizing Federated Learning (FL), a distributed machine learning (ML) technique that allows for model training without data relocation. However, the conventional FL algorithm lacks the requisite functionality for both the security defense model and the rewards system of the AMI network. This work presents two solutions: first, an enhanced and cost-efficient FedAvg algorithm incorporating a novel data quality measure, and second, FedPot, the development of an effective security model with a fair incentives mechanism under an FL architecture. Accordingly, SPSs are limited to sharing the ML model they learn after efficiently measuring their local data quality, whereas TPRs can verify the participants' uploaded models and fairly compensate each participant for their contributions through rewards. Simulation results, drawn from realistic mircorgrid network log datasets, demonstrate that the proposed solutions outperform state-of-the-art techniques by enhancing the security model and guaranteeing fair reward distributions.",

In this paper, we present a comprehensive tutorial overview for junior researchers in this field, aiming to offer a foundational guide for resource allocation design in the context of next-generation multiple access (NGMA). Initially, we identify three types of channels in future wireless cellular networks over which NGMA will be implemented, namely: natural channels, reconfigurable channels, and functional channels. Natural channels are traditional uplink and downlink communication channels; reconfigurable channels are defined as channels that can be proactively reshaped via emerging platforms or techniques, such as intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and movable/fluid antenna (M/FA); and functional channels support not only communication but also other functionalities simultaneously, with typical examples including integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and joint computing and communication (JCAC) channels. Then, we introduce NGMA models applicable to these three types of channels that cover most of the practical communication scenarios of future wireless communications. Subsequently, we articulate the key optimization technical challenges inherent in the resource allocation design for NGMA, categorizing them into rate-oriented, power-oriented, and reliability-oriented resource allocation designs. The corresponding optimization approaches for solving the formulated resource allocation design problems are then presented. Finally, simulation results are presented and discussed to elucidate the practical implications and insights derived from resource allocation designs in NGMA.",

As fixed buoy acts as amplify-and-forward relays, the second UOWC link represents downlink signal transmission from the floating buoy to the underwater device. Best relay selection is adopted, meaning that only the buoy with the best estimated RF-based UAV-buoy channel will perform signal transmission to an underwater device. Analytical expression for the outage probability is derived and utilized to examine the system's performance behaviour for various UOWC and RF channel conditions.",

In the considered model, users employ semantic information extraction techniques to compress the original data before sending it to the base station (BS). During this semantic compression process, knowledge graphs are employed to represent the semantic information, and the probability graph sharing between users and the BS is utilized to further compress the knowledge graph. The semantic compression process can significantly reduce the transmitted data size, but it inevitably introduces additional computation overhead. Considering the limited power budget of the user, we formulate a joint communication and computation optimization problem is formulated aiming to maximize the minimum equivalent rate among all users while meeting total power and semantic compression ratio constraints. To address this problem, two algorithms with different computational complexities are proposed to obtain suboptimal solutions. One algorithm is based on a prorate distribution of transmission power, while the other traverses the combinations of semantic compression ratios among all users. In both algorithms, bisection is employed in order to achieve the greatest minimum equivalent rate. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

While the previously used method based on a SAT solver was limited to three qubits, this new method is much faster and more versatile, enabling us to also handle four- to six-qubit cases. The four-qubit unsatisfied configurations we found are quite remarkable. That of an elliptic quadric features 315 lines and has in its core three copies of the split Cayley hexagon of order two having a Heawood-graph-underpinned geometry in common. That of a hyperbolic quadric also has 315 lines but, as a point-line incidence structure, is isomorphic to the dual $\\mathcal{DW}(5,2)$ of $\\mathcal{W}(5,2)$. Finally, an unsatisfied configuration with 1575 lines associated with all the lines/contexts of the four-qubit space contains a distinguished $\\mathcal{DW}(5,2)$ centered on a point-plane incidence graph of PG$(3,2)$. The corresponding configurations found in the five-qubit space exhibit a considerably higher degree of complexity, except for a hyperbolic quadric, whose 6975 unsatisfied contexts are compactified around the point-hyperplane incidence graph of PG$(4,2)$. The most remarkable unsatisfied patterns discovered in the six-qubit space are a couple of disjoint split Cayley hexagons (for the full space) and a subgeometry underpinned by the complete bipartite graph $K_{7,7}$ (for a hyperbolic quadric).",

To solve the aforementioned issues, an index-space-wave state superposition Transformer (ISWSST) is the first to be proposed for MSRSI semantic segmentation by the inspiration from quantum mechanics, whose superiority is as follows: 1) index, space and wave states are superposed or fused to simulate quantum superposition by adaptively voting decision (i.e., ensemble learning idea) for being a stronger classifier and improving the segmentation accuracy; 2) a lossless wavelet pyramid encoder-decoder module is designed to losslessly reconstruct image and simulate quantum entanglement based on wavelet transform and inverse wavelet transform for avoiding the edge extraction loss; 3) combining multispectral features (i.e. remote sensing index and channel attention mechanism) is proposed to accurately extract ground objects from original resolution images; and 4) quantum mechanics are introduced to interpret the underlying superiority of ISWSST. Experiments show that ISWSST is validated and superior to the state-of-the-art architectures for the MSRSI segmentation task, which improves the segmentation and edge extraction accuracy effectively.

Traditional explicit methods in LM rely on the point spread function (PSF) during image acquisition. Yet, these approaches often fall short due to inaccurate PSF models and noise artifacts, hampering the overall restoration quality. In this paper, we approached the optic deconvolution as an inverse problem. Motivated by the nonstandard-form compression scheme introduced by Beylkin, Coifman, and Rokhlin (BCR), we proposed an innovative physics-informed neural network Multi-Stage Residual-BCR Net (m-rBCR) to approximate the optic deconvolution. We validated the m-rBCR model on four microscopy datasets - two simulated microscopy datasets from ImageNet and BioSR, real dSTORM microscopy images, and real widefield microscopy images. In contrast to the explicit deconvolution methods (e.g. Richardson-Lucy) and other state-of-the-art NN models (U-Net, DDPM, CARE, DnCNN, ESRGAN, RCAN, Noise2Noise, MPRNet, and MIMO-U-Net), the m-rBCR model demonstrates superior performance to other candidates by PSNR and SSIM in two real microscopy datasets and the simulated BioSR dataset. In the simulated ImageNet dataset, m-rBCR ranks the second-best place (right after MIMO-U-Net). With the backbone from the optical physics, m-rBCR exploits the trainable parameters with better performances (from ~30 times fewer than the benchmark MIMO-U-Net to ~210 times than ESRGAN). This enables m-rBCR to achieve a shorter runtime (from ~3 times faster than MIMO-U-Net to ~300 times faster than DDPM). To summarize, by leveraging physics constraints our model reduced potentially redundant parameters significantly in expertise-oriented NN candidates and achieved high efficiency with superior performance.",

This work aims to enhance temporal resolution in dynamic MR temperature map reconstruction using an improved deep learning method. The training-optimized methods and five classical neural networks were applied on the 2-fold and 4-fold under-sampling k-space data to reconstruct the temperature maps. The enhanced training modules included offline/online data augmentations, knowledge distillation, and the amplitude-phase decoupling loss function. The heating experiments were performed by a FUS transducer on phantom and ex vivo tissues, respectively. These data were manually under-sampled to imitate acceleration procedures and trained in our method to get the reconstruction model. The additional dozen or so testing datasets were separately obtained for evaluating the real-time performance and temperature accuracy. Acceleration factors of 1.9 and 3.7 were found for 2 times and 4 times k-space under-sampling strategies and the ResUNet-based deep learning reconstruction performed exceptionally well. In 2-fold acceleration scenario, the RMSE of temperature map patches provided the values of 0.888 degree centigrade and 1.145 degree centigrade on phantom and ex vivo testing datasets. The DICE value of temperature areas enclosed by 43 degree centigrade isotherm was 0.809, and the Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of -0.253 degree centigrade with the apart of plus or minus 2.16 degree centigrade. In 4 times under-sampling case, these evaluating values decreased by approximately 10%. This study demonstrates that deep learning-based reconstruction can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of MR thermometry for clinical FUS thermal therapies.",

Current approaches like semantic scene completion (SSC) require pre-enumerating the set of classes and costly human annotations, while representation learning methods relax these assumptions but are not robust to occlusions and learn representations tailored towards auxiliary tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LSMap, a method that lifts masks from visual foundation models to predict a continuous, open-set semantic and elevation-aware representation in bird's eye view (BEV) for the entire scene, including regions underneath dynamic entities and in occluded areas. Our model only requires a single RGBD image, does not require human labels, and operates in real time. We quantitatively demonstrate our approach outperforms existing models trained from scratch on semantic and elevation scene completion tasks with finetuning. Furthermore, we show that our pre-trained representation outperforms existing visual foundation models at unsupervised semantic scene completion. We evaluate our approach using CODa, a large-scale, real-world urban robot dataset. Supplementary visualizations, code, data, and pre-trained models, will be publicly available soon.",

The emergence of 5G and the forthcoming 6G networks presents an enormous potential to transform the IoV by enabling ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-bandwidth communications. Nevertheless, as connectivity expands, cybersecurity threats have become a significant concern. The issue has been further exacerbated by the rising number of zero-day (0-day) attacks, which can exploit unknown vulnerabilities and bypass existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). In this paper, we propose Zero-X, an innovative security framework that effectively detects both 0-day and N-day attacks. The framework achieves this by combining deep neural networks with Open-Set Recognition (OSR). Our approach introduces a novel scheme that uses blockchain technology to facilitate trusted and decentralized federated learning (FL) of the ZeroX framework. This scheme also prioritizes privacy preservation, enabling both CAVs and Security Operation Centers (SOCs) to contribute their unique knowledge while protecting the privacy of their sensitive data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage OSR in combination with privacy-preserving FL to identify both 0-day and N-day attacks in the realm of IoV. The in-depth experiments on two recent network traffic datasets show that the proposed framework achieved a high detection rate while minimizing the false positive rate. Comparison with related work showed that the Zero-X framework outperforms existing solutions.",

In this context, a wide range of advanced machine/deep learning based solutions have been designed to accurately detect security attacks. Specifically, supervised learning techniques have been widely applied to train attack detection models. However, the main limitation of such solutions is their inability to detect attacks different from those seen during the training phase, or new attacks, also called zero-day attacks. Moreover, training the detection model requires significant data collection and labeling, which increases the communication overhead, and raises privacy concerns. To address the aforementioned limits, we propose in this paper a novel detection mechanism that leverages the ability of the deep auto-encoder method to detect attacks relying only on the benign network traffic pattern. Using federated learning, the proposed intrusion detection system can be trained with large and diverse benign network traffic, while preserving the CAVs privacy, and minimizing the communication overhead. The in-depth experiment on a recent network traffic dataset shows that the proposed system achieved a high detection rate while minimizing the false positive rate, and the detection delay.",

We validate our approach using two state-of-the-art DGMs, namely, a Variational Autoencoder and a Generative Adversarial Network, to show that our artificial inductive bias fuels superior synthetic data quality, as measured by Jensen-Shannon divergence, achieving relative gains of up to 50\\% when using our proposed approach.

Specifically, for any $\\varepsilon>0$, our algorithms return, with high probability, an estimate of the ground state energy of $H$ within additive error $\\varepsilon M$, or a quantum state with the corresponding energy. Here, $M$ is the total strength of all interaction terms, which in general is extensive in the system size. Our approach makes no assumptions about the geometry or spatial locality of interaction terms of the input Hamiltonian and thus handles even long-range or all-to-all interactions, such as in quantum chemistry, where lattice-based techniques break down. In this fully general setting, the runtime of our algorithms scales as $2^{cn/2}$ for $c<1$, yielding the first quantum algorithms for low-energy estimation breaking the natural bound based on Grover search. The core of our approach is remarkably simple, and relies on showing that any $k$-body Hamiltonian has a low-energy subspace of exponential dimension.",

An UAV with computing capability can provide task offlaoding services to ground internet-of-things devices (IDs). With partial observation of the entire network state, the UAV and the IDs individually determine their MEC strategies, i.e., UAV trajectory, resource allocation, and task offloading policy. This requires joint optimization of decision-making process and coordination strategies among the UAV and the IDs. To address this difficulty, the proposed cooperative MADRL approach computes two types of action variables, namely message action and solution action, each of which is generated by dedicated actor neural networks (NNs). As a result, each agent can automatically encapsulate its coordination messages to enhance the MEC performance in the decentralized manner. The proposed actor structure is designed based on graph attention networks such that operations are possible regardless of the number of IDs. A scalable training algorithm is also proposed to train a group of NNs for arbitrary network configurations. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed cooperative MADRL approach over conventional methods.",

In response, we introduce a cutting-edge smartphone-based localization system for IoT devices, leveraging the precise positioning capabilities of smartphones equipped with motion sensors. Our system employs artificial intelligence (AI) to merge channel state information from proximal trajectory points of a single smartphone, significantly enhancing line of sight (LoS) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation accuracy, particularly under severe multipath conditions. Additionally, we have developed an AI-based anomaly detection algorithm to further increase the reliability of LoSAoA estimation. This algorithm improves measurement reliability by analyzing the correlation between the accuracy of reversed feature reconstruction and the LoS-AoA estimation. Utilizing a straightforward least squares algorithm in conjunction with accurate LoS-AoA estimation and smartphone positional data, our system efficiently identifies IoT device locations. Validated through extensive simulations and experimental tests with a receiving antenna array comprising just two patch antenna elements in the horizontal direction, our methodology has been shown to attain decimeter-level localization accuracy in nearly 90% of cases, demonstrating robust performance even in challenging real-world scenarios.

        "abstract": "We revisit the problem of statistical sequence matching between two databases of sequences initiated by Unnikrishnan (TIT 2015) and derive theoretical performance guarantees for the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). We first consider the case where the number of matched pairs of sequences between the databases is known. In this case, the task is to accurately find the matched pairs of sequences among all possible matches between the sequences in the two databases. We analyze the performance of the GLRT by Unnikrishnan and explicitly characterize the tradeoff between the mismatch and false reject probabilities under each hypothesis in both large and small deviations regimes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the optimality of Unnikrishnan's GLRT test under the generalized Neyman-Person criterion for both regimes and illustrate our theoretical results via numerical examples. Subsequently, we generalize our achievability analyses to the case where the number of matched pairs is unknown, and an additional error probability needs to be considered. When one of the two databases contains a single sequence, the problem of statistical sequence matching specializes to the problem of multiple classification introduced by Gutman (TIT 1989). For this special case, our result for the small deviations regime strengthens previous result of Zhou, Tan and Motani (Information and Inference 2020) by removing unnecessary conditions on the generating distributions.",

        "abstract": "Modern software development necessitates efficient version-oriented collaboration among developers. While Git is the most popular version control system, it generates unsatisfactory version merging results due to textual-based workflow, leading to potentially unexpected results in the merged version of the project. Although numerous merging tools have been proposed for improving merge results, developers remain struggling to resolve the conflicts and fix incorrectly modified code without clues. We present WizardMerge, an auxiliary tool that leverages merging results from Git to retrieve code block dependency on text and LLVM-IR level and provide suggestions for developers to resolve errors introduced by textual merging. Through the evaluation, we subjected WizardMerge to testing on 227 conflicts within five large-scale projects. The outcomes demonstrate that WizardMerge diminishes conflict merging time costs, achieving a 23.85% reduction. Beyond addressing conflicts, WizardMerge provides merging suggestions for over 70% of the code blocks potentially affected by the conflicts. Notably, WizardMerge exhibits the capability to identify conflict-unrelated code blocks that require manual intervention yet are harmfully applied by Git during the merging.",

One such task is data analysis, which is notoriously challenging for non-expert end-users due to its expertise requirements, and where AI holds much potential, such as finding relevant data sources, proposing analysis strategies, and writing analysis code. To understand how data analysis workflows can be assisted or impaired by generative AI, we conducted a study (n=15) using Bing Chat via participatory prompting. Participatory prompting is a recently developed methodology in which users and researchers reflect together on tasks through co-engagement with generative AI. In this paper we demonstrate the value of the participatory prompting method.

        "abstract": "In-memory computing (IMC) has gained significant attention recently as it attempts to reduce the impact of memory bottlenecks. Numerous schemes for digital IMC are presented in the literature, focusing on logic operations. Often, an application's description has data dependencies that must be resolved. Contemporary IMC architectures perform read followed by write operations for this purpose, which results in performance and energy penalties. To solve this fundamental problem, this paper presents in-memory mirroring (IMM). IMM eliminates the need for read and write-back steps, thus avoiding energy and performance penalties. Instead, we perform data movement within memory, involving row-wise and column-wise data transfers. Additionally, the IMM scheme enables parallel cloning of entire row (word) with a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. Moreover, our analysis of the energy consumption of the proposed technique using resistive random-access memory crossbar and experimentally validated JART VCM v1b model. The IMM increases energy efficiency and shows 2$\\times$ performance improvement compared to conventional data movement methods.",

        "abstract": "With the rising demand for high-rate and timely communications, fog radio access networks (F-RANs) offer a promising solution. This work investigates age of information (AoI) performance in F-RANs, consisting of multiple content users (CUs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs), and content providers (CPs). Time-critical CUs need rapid content updates from CPs but cannot communicate directly with them; instead, eRRHs act as intermediaries. CUs decide whether to request content from a CP and which eRRH to send the request to, while eRRHs decide whether to command CPs to update content or use cached content. We study two general classes of policies: (i) oblivious policies, where decision-making is independent of historical information, and (ii) non-oblivious policies, where decisions are influenced by historical information. First, we obtain closed-form expressions for the average AoI of eRRHs under both policy types. Due to the complexity of calculating closed-form expressions for CUs, we then derive general upper bounds for their average AoI. Next, we identify optimal policies for both types. Under both optimal policies, each CU requests content from each CP at an equal rate, consolidating all requests to a single eRRH when demand is low or resources are limited, and distributing requests evenly among eRRHs when demand is high and resources are ample. eRRHs command content from each CP at an equal rate under an optimal oblivious policy, while prioritize the CP with the highest age under an optimal non-oblivious policy. Our numerical results validate these theoretical findings.",

        "abstract": "Sampling-based kinodynamic motion planners (SKMPs) are powerful in finding collision-free trajectories for high-dimensional systems under differential constraints. Time-informed set (TIS) can provide the heuristic search domain to accelerate their convergence to the time-optimal solution. However, existing TIS approximation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, computational burden, and limited system applicable scope, e.g., linear and polynomial nonlinear systems. To overcome these problems, we propose a method by leveraging deep learning technology, Koopman operator theory, and random set theory. Specifically, we propose a Deep Invertible Koopman operator with control U model named DIKU to predict states forward and backward over a long horizon by modifying the auxiliary network with an invertible neural network. A sampling-based approach, ASKU, performing reachability analysis for the DIKU is developed to approximate the TIS of nonlinear control systems online. Furthermore, we design an online time-informed SKMP using a direct sampling technique to draw uniform random samples in the TIS. Simulation experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms other existing works, approximating TIS in near real-time and achieving superior planning performance in several time-optimal kinodynamic motion planning problems.",

        "abstract": "In GPUs, the control flow management mechanism determines which threads in a warp are active at any point in time. This mechanism monitors the control flow of scalar threads within a warp to optimize thread scheduling and plays a critical role in the utilization of execution resources. The control flow management mechanism can be controlled or assisted by software through instructions. However, GPU vendors do not disclose details about their compiler, ISA, or hardware implementations. This lack of transparency makes it challenging for researchers to understand how the control flow management mechanism functions, is implemented, or is assisted by software, which is crucial when it significantly affects their research. It is also problematic for performance modeling of GPUs, as one can only rely on traces from real hardware for control flow and cannot model or modify the functionality of the mechanism altering it. This paper addresses this issue by defining a plausible semantic for control flow instructions in the Turing native ISA based on insights gleaned from experimental data using various benchmarks. Based on these definitions, we propose a low-cost mechanism for efficient control flow management named Hanoi. Hanoi ensures correctness and generates a control flow that is very close to real hardware. Our evaluation shows that the discrepancy between the control flow trace of real hardware and our mechanism is only 1.03% on average. Furthermore, when comparing the Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) of GPUs employing Hanoi with the native control flow management of actual hardware, the average difference is just 0.19%.",

While this approach is resilient to channel variations, it may result in low rates for state sequences that are associated with relatively good channels. This paper addresses the analysis of AVCs through the lens of competitive analysis, where solution quality is measured with respect to the optimal solution had the state sequence been known in advance. Our main result demonstrates that codes constructed by a single input distribution do not achieve optimal competitive performance over AVCs. This stands in contrast to the single-letter capacity formulae for AVCs, and it indicates, in our setting, that even though the encoder cannot predict the subsequent channel states, it benefits from varying its input distribution as time proceeds.",

We introduce the concept of sensing subspace codes following this structure, and show how these codes can be controlled by judiciously designing the sensor array geometry. We further present a construction of sensing subspace codes leveraging a certain class of Golomb rulers that achieve near-optimal minimum codeword distance. These designs inspire novel noise-robust sparse array geometries achieving high angular resolution. We also prove that codes corresponding to conventional uniform linear arrays are suboptimal in this regard.

        "abstract": "Verification of higher-order probabilistic programs is a challenging problem. We present a verification method that supports several quantitative properties of higher-order probabilistic programs. Usually, extending verification methods to handle the quantitative aspects of probabilistic programs often entails extensive modifications to existing tools, reducing compatibility with advanced techniques developed for qualitative verification. In contrast, our approach necessitates only small amounts of modification, facilitating the reuse of existing techniques and implementations. On the theoretical side, we propose a dependent refinement type system for a generalised higher-order fixed point logic (HFL). Combined with continuation-passing style encodings of properties into HFL, our dependent refinement type system enables reasoning about several quantitative properties, including weakest pre-expectations, expected costs, moments of cost, and conditional weakest pre-expectations for higher-order probabilistic programs with continuous distributions and conditioning. The soundness of our approach is proved in a general setting using a framework of categorical semantics so that we don't have to repeat similar proofs for each individual problem. On the empirical side, we implement a type checker for our dependent refinement type system that reduces the problem of type checking to constraint solving. We introduce admissible predicate variables and integrable predicate variables to constrained Horn clauses (CHC) so that we can soundly reason about the least fixed points and samplings from probability distributions. Our implementation demonstrates that existing CHC solvers developed for non-probabilistic programs can be extended to a solver for the extended CHC with only small efforts. We also demonstrate the ability of our type checker to verify various concrete examples.",

Accordingly, in this paper, we designed and developed an immersive escape room game in VR to teach building energy simulation topics. In the game, players must solve puzzles like, for instance, assembling walls using different materials. We use a player guidance system that combines educational content, puzzles, and different types of hints to educate the players about parameters that influence energy efficiency, structural resistance, and costs. To improve user onboarding, we implemented a tutorial level to teach players general interactions and locomotion. To assess the user experience, we evaluate both the tutorial and the game with an expert study with gaming and VR experts (n=11). The participants were asked to play both the tutorial level and the escape room level and complete two sets of post-questionnaires, one after the tutorial and one after the puzzle level. The one after the tutorial level consisted of NASA-TLX and SUS questionnaires, while after the escape room level we asked users to complete the NASA-TLX, UESSF, and PXI questionnaires. The results indicate that the onboarding level successfully provided good usability while maintaining a low task load. On the other hand, the escape room level can provide an engaging, visually appealing, and usable learning environment by arousing players' curiosity through the gameplay.

It can be made collaborative by implementing a conflict resolution algorithm either on the client side (in peer-to-peer collaboration) or on the server side (when using web sockets and a central server to monitor state changes). Although web sockets are ideal for real-time text editors, using multiple collaborative editors on one connection can create problems. This is because a single web connection cannot monitor which user is collaborating on which application state, leading to unnecessary network queries and data being delivered to the wrong state. To address this issue, the current solution is to open multiple web socket connections, with one web socket per collaboration application. However, this can add significant overhead proportional to the number of apps utilized. In this study, we demonstrate an algorithm that enables using a single web socket for multiple collaborative applications in a collaborative editor. Our method involves modifying the socket's code to track which application's shared state is being worked on and by whom. This allows for the simultaneous collaboration of multiple states in real-time, with infinite users, without opening a different socket for each application. Our optimized editor showed an efficiency improvement of over 96% in access time duration.

        "abstract": "With the advancement of software rendering techniques, GUI pages in mobile apps now encompass a wealth of visual information, where the visual semantics of each page contribute to the overall app logic, presenting new challenges to software testing. Despite the progress in automated Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing, the absence of testing oracles has constrained its efficacy to identify only crash bugs with evident abnormal signals. Nonetheless, there are still a considerable number of non-crash bugs, ranging from unexpected behaviors to misalignments, often evading detection by existing techniques. While these bugs can exhibit visual cues that serve as potential testing oracles, they often entail a sequence of screenshots, and detecting them necessitates an understanding of the operational logic among GUI page transitions, which is challenging traditional techniques. Considering the remarkable performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) in visual and language understanding, this paper proposes a vision-driven automated GUI testing approach VisionDroid to detect non-crash functional bugs with MLLM. It begins by extracting GUI text information and aligning it with screenshots to form a vision prompt, enabling MLLM to understand GUI context. The function-aware explorer then employs MLLM for deeper and function-oriented GUI page exploration, while the logic-aware bug detector segments the entire exploration history into logically cohesive parts and prompts the MLLM for bug detection. We evaluate VisionDroid on three datasets and compare it with 10 baselines, demonstrating its excellent performance. The ablation study further proves the contribution of each module. Moreover, VisionDroid identifies 29 new bugs on Google Play, of which 19 have been confirmed and fixed.",

However, this constant flow can lead to moments where users are simply passing time rather than engaging meaningfully. This underscores the importance of developing methods to identify these \"time-killing\" moments, enabling the delivery of important notifications in a way that minimizes interruptions and enhances user engagement. Recent work has utilized screenshots taken every 5 seconds to detect time-killing activities on smartphones. However, this method often misses to capture phone usage between intervals. We demonstrate that up to 50% of time-killing instances go undetected using screenshots, leading to substantial gaps in understanding user behavior. To address this limitation, we propose a method called ScreenTK that detects time-killing moments by leveraging continuous screen text monitoring and on-device large language models (LLMs). Screen text contains more comprehensive information than screenshots and allows LLMs to summarize detailed phone usage. To verify our framework, we conducted experiments with six participants, capturing 1,034 records of different time-killing moments. Initial results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by 38% in our case study.",

Additionally, we compare the efficacy of this streaming workflow against the conventional file-transfer workflow by conducting a post-mortem analysis on historical data from experiments performed by real users. Our findings show that the streaming workflow significantly improves data turnaround time, enables real-time decision-making, and minimizes the potential for human error by eliminating manual user interactions.",

        "abstract": "Photonic neural networks offer a promising alternative to traditional electronic systems for machine learning accelerators due to their low latency and energy efficiency. However, the challenge of implementing the backpropagation algorithm during training has limited their development. To address this, alternative machine learning schemes, such as extreme learning machines (ELMs), have been proposed. ELMs use a random hidden layer to increase the feature space dimensionality, requiring only the output layer to be trained through linear regression, thus reducing training complexity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a programmable photonic extreme learning machine (PPELM) using a hexagonal waveguide mesh, and which enables to program directly on chip the input feature vector and the random hidden layer. Our system also permits to apply the nonlinearity directly on-chip by using the systems integrated photodetecting elements. Using the PPELM we solved successfully three different complex classification tasks. Additioanlly, we also propose and demonstrate two techniques to increase the accuracy of the models and reduce their variability using an evolutionary algorithm and a wavelength division multiplexing approach, obtaining excellent performance. Our results show that programmable photonic processors may become a feasible way to train competitive machine learning models on a versatile and compact platform.",

To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm and employ semidefinite relaxation (SDR), sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SRCR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Numerical results indicate that the MA and RIS-aided ISAC system outperforms conventional fixed position antenna (FPA) and RIS-aided systems. In addition, the application of MAs can reduce the similarity of user channels and enhance channel gain in the ISAC system.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a surge in the development of models for the generation of synthetic mobility data. These models aim to facilitate the sharing of data while safeguarding privacy, all while ensuring high utility and flexibility regarding potential applications. However, current utility evaluation methods fail to fully account for real-life requirements. We evaluate the utility of five state-of-the-art synthesis approaches, each with and without the incorporation of differential privacy (DP) guarantees, in terms of real-world applicability. Specifically, we focus on so-called trip data that encode fine granular urban movements such as GPS-tracked taxi rides. Such data prove particularly valuable for downstream tasks at the road network level. Thus, our initial step involves appropriately map matching the synthetic data and subsequently comparing the resulting trips with those generated by the routing algorithm implemented in OpenStreetMap, which serves as an efficient and privacy-friendly baseline. Out of the five evaluated models, one fails to produce data within reasonable computation time and another generates too many jumps to meet the requirements for map matching. The remaining three models succeed to a certain degree in maintaining spatial distribution, one even with DP guarantees. However, all models struggle to produce meaningful sequences of geo-locations with reasonable trip lengths and to model traffic flow at intersections accurately. It is important to note that trip data encompasses various relevant characteristics beyond spatial distribution, such as temporal information, all of which are discarded by these models. Consequently, our results imply that current synthesis models fall short in their promise of high utility and flexibility.",

        "abstract": "Effective collaboration between humans and AIs hinges on transparent communication and alignment of mental models. However, explicit, verbal communication is not always feasible. Under such circumstances, human-human teams often depend on implicit, nonverbal cues to glean important information about their teammates such as intent and expertise, thereby bolstering team alignment and adaptability. Among these implicit cues, two of the most salient and fundamental are a human's actions in the environment and their visual attention. In this paper, we present a novel method to combine eye gaze data and behavioral data, and evaluate their respective predictive power for human proficiency, trust, and intent. We first collect a dataset of paired eye gaze and gameplay data in the fast-paced collaborative \"Overcooked\" environment. We then train models on this dataset to compare how the predictive powers differ between gaze data, gameplay data, and their combination. We additionally compare our method to prior works that aggregate eye gaze data and demonstrate how these aggregation methods can substantially reduce the predictive ability of eye gaze. Our results indicate that, while eye gaze data and gameplay data excel in different situations, a model that integrates both types consistently outperforms all baselines.

        "abstract": "We study fair division of $m$ indivisible chores among $n$ agents with additive preferences. We consider the desirable fairness notions of envy-freeness up to any chore (EFX) and envy-freeness up to $k$ chores (EF$k$), alongside the efficiency notion of Pareto optimality (PO). We present the first constant approximations of these notions, showing the existence of: - 5-EFX allocations, which improves the best-known factor of $O(n^2)$-EFX. - 3-EFX and PO allocations for the special case of bivalued instances, which improves the best-known factor of $O(n)$-EFX without any efficiency guarantees. - 2-EF2 + PO allocations, which improves the best-known factor of EF$m$ and PO. A notable contribution of our work is the introduction of the novel concept of earning-restricted (ER) competitive equilibrium for fractional allocations, which limits agents' earnings from each chore. Technically, our work addresses two main challenges: proving the existence of an ER equilibrium and designing algorithms that leverage ER equilibria to achieve the above results. To tackle the first challenge, we formulate a linear complementarity problem (LCP) formulation that captures all ER equilibria and show that the classic complementary pivot algorithm on the LCP must terminate at an ER equilibrium. For the second challenge, we carefully set the earning limits and use properties of ER equilibria to design sophisticated procedures that involve swapping and merging bundles to meet the desired fairness and efficiency criteria. We expect that the concept of ER equilibrium will be instrumental in deriving further results on related problems.",

        "abstract": "The urban rail transit (URT) system attracts many commuters with its punctuality and convenience. However, it is vulnerable to disruptions caused by factors like extreme weather and temporary equipment failures, which greatly impact passengers' journeys and diminish the system's service quality. In this study, we propose targeted travel guidance for passengers at different space-time locations by devising passenger rescheduling strategies during disruptions. This guidance not only offers insights into route changes but also provides practical recommendations for delaying departure times when required. We present a novel three-feature four-group passenger classification principle, integrating temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal features to classify passengers in disrupted URT networks. This approach results in the creation of four distinct solution spaces based on passenger groups. A mixed integer programming model is built based on individual level considering the First-in-First-out (FIFO) rule in oversaturated networks. Additionally, we present a two-stage solution approach for handling the complex issues in large-scale networks. Experimental results from both small-scale artificial networks and the real-world Beijing URT network validate the efficacy of our proposed passenger rescheduling strategies in mitigating disruptions. Specifically, when compared to scenarios with no travel guidance during disruptions, our strategies achieve a substantial reduction in total passenger travel time by 29.7% and 50.9% respectively, underscoring the effectiveness in managing unexpected disruptions.",

        "abstract": "Practical optimization problems may contain different kinds of difficulties that are often not tractable if one relies on a particular optimization method. Different optimization approaches offer different strengths that are good at tackling one or more difficulty in an optimization problem. For instance, evolutionary algorithms have a niche in handling complexities like discontinuity, non-differentiability, discreteness and non-convexity. However, evolutionary algorithms may get computationally expensive for mathematically well behaved problems with large number of variables for which classical mathematical programming approaches are better suited. In this paper, we demonstrate a decomposition strategy that allows us to synergistically apply two complementary approaches at the same time on a complex optimization problem. Evolutionary algorithms are useful in this context as their flexibility makes pairing with other solution approaches easy. The decomposition idea is a special case of bilevel optimization that separates the difficulties into two levels and assigns different approaches at each level that is better equipped at handling them. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed decomposition idea on a wide range of test problems.",

A basic version of the algorithm introduces small random perturbations to the received symbols before each SCL decoding attempt, and exhibits non-diminishing gain at large block lengths. Its enhanced version adaptively performs random perturbations or directional perturbation on each received symbol according to previous decoding results, and managed to correct more errors with fewer decoding attempts. Extensive simulation results demonstrate stable gains across various code rates, lengths and list sizes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SCL enhancement with non-diminishing gains as code length increases, and achieves unprecedented efficiency. With only one additional SCL-$L$ decoding attempt (in total two), the proposed algorithm achieves SCL-$2L$-equivalent performance.

This article provides an overview of the SIM technology by discussing its hardware architectures, advantages, and potential applications for wireless sensing and communication. Specifically, we explore the utilization of SIMs in enabling wave-domain beamforming, channel modeling and estimation in SIM-assisted communication systems. Furthermore, we elaborate on the potential of utilizing a SIM to build a hybrid optical-electronic neural network (HOENN) and demonstrate its efficacy by examining two case studies: disaster monitoring and direction-of-arrival estimation. Finally, we identify key implementation challenges, including practical hardware imperfections, efficient SIM configuration for realizing wave-domain signal processing, and performance analysis to motivate future research on this important and far-reaching topic.",

        "abstract": "The rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) has underscored the importance of serving ML models with high throughput and resource efficiency. Traditional approaches to managing increasing query demands have predominantly focused on hardware scaling, which involves increasing server count or computing power. However, this strategy can often be impractical due to limitations in the available budget or compute resources. As an alternative, accuracy scaling offers a promising solution by adjusting the accuracy of ML models to accommodate fluctuating query demands. Yet, existing accuracy scaling techniques target independent ML models and tend to underperform while managing inference pipelines. Furthermore, they lack integration with hardware scaling, leading to potential resource inefficiencies during low-demand periods. To address the limitations, this paper introduces Loki, a system designed for serving inference pipelines effectively with both hardware and accuracy scaling. Loki incorporates an innovative theoretical framework for optimal resource allocation and an effective query routing algorithm, aimed at improving system accuracy and minimizing latency deadline violations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that through accuracy scaling, the effective capacity of a fixed-size cluster can be enhanced by more than $2.7\\times$ compared to relying solely on hardware scaling. When compared with state-of-the-art inference-serving systems, Loki achieves up to a $10\\times$ reduction in Service Level Objective (SLO) violations, with minimal compromises on accuracy and while fulfilling throughput demands.",

        "rating": "-10",
        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "We propose efficient minimum-distance decoding and list-decoding algorithms for a certain class of analog subspace codes, referred to as character-polynomial (CP) codes, recently introduced by Soleymani and the second author. In particular, a CP code without its character can be viewed as a subcode of a Reed-Solomon (RS) code, where a certain subset of the coefficients of the message polynomial is set to zeros. We then demonstrate how classical decoding methods, including list decoders, for RS codes can be leveraged for decoding CP codes. For instance, it is shown that, in almost all cases, the list decoder behaves as a unique decoder. We also present a probabilistic analysis of the improvements in list decoding of CP codes when leveraging their certain structure as subcodes of RS codes.",

        "title": "Augmenting LLMs to Repair Obsolete Test Cases with Static Collector and Neural Reranker",
        "rating": "-10",
        "keywords": [],
        "abstract": "During software evolution, it is advocated that test code should co-evolve with production code. In real development scenarios, test updating may lag behind production code changing, which may cause the project to fail to compile or bring other troubles. Existing techniques based on pre-trained language models can be adopted to repair obsolete tests caused by such unsynchronized code changes, especially syntactic-related ones. However, the lack of target-oriented contextual information affects repair accuracy on large-scale projects. Starting from an obsoleted test, the key challenging task is precisely identifying and constructing Test-Repair-Oriented Contexts (TROCtx) from the whole repository within a limited token size. In this paper, we propose SynBCIATR (Syntactic-Breaking-Change-Induced Automated Test Repair), a novel approach to automatically repair obsolete test cases via precise and concise TROCtx construction. Inspired by developers' programming practices of the task, we design three types of TROCtx: class contexts, usage contexts, and environment contexts. For every type of TROCtx, SynBCIATR automatically collects the changed-token-related code information through static analysis techniques. Then it generates reranking queries to identify the most relevant TROCtxs, which will be taken as the repair-required key context and be input to the Large Language Model for the final test repair. To evaluate the effectiveness of SynBCIATR, we construct a benchmark dataset that contains diverse syntactic breaking changes. The experimental results show that SynBCIATR outperforms baseline approaches both on textual- and intent-matching metrics. With the augmentation of TROCtx constructed by SynBCIATR, hallucinations are reduced by 57.1%.",
